        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about hyphenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hyphens are those little signs – like dashes – that we use in writing to join two words together.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, like in <strong>old-fashioned. </strong>There's always a hyphen between<strong> old </strong>and <strong>fashioned. </strong>Let's start with a clip from Brian. He's a news reporter, and he's reporting from a high school about an election.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Think about this question while you're listening: How does Brian describe the young people at the school? Here's Brian.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at <strong>this secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election. They're all <strong>hard-working </strong>young people. <strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision. But a sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date</strong>. Back to the studio.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we asked you: How does Brian describe the young people at the school?  </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: He says they are <strong>hard-working.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That means they work hard. Now there are lots of compound adjectives like <strong>hard-working</strong> that we make with an adjective or adverb like <strong>hard</strong> plus a present participle like <strong>working</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we always write them with a hyphen. So <strong>hard hyphen working</strong> (hard-working).</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we can make compound adjectives in other ways too. Listen to this clip for three more examples.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at this<strong> secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election. <strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>First we had <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> <strong>students</strong>. <strong>Eighteen-year-old</strong> is an adjective made from three words joined together with hyphens. When we write age before a noun, we use hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Eighteen hyphen year hyphen old</strong> (eighteen-year-old)<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with numbers; for example, we write the phrase <strong>a two-door car</strong> like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>A two hyphen door car</strong> (a two-door car)<strong>. </strong>But that's only for numbers <strong>before</strong> the noun. If you write: <strong>the students are eighteen years old</strong>, you don't need hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, the second compound in that clip was <strong>twenty-two</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the rule is: always use hyphens in numbers from <strong>twenty-one</strong> to <strong>ninety-nine</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Twenty hyphen one </strong>(twenty-one). Two hundred and <strong>ninety hyphen nine </strong>(two hundred and ninety-nine).</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good. Now the last compound adjective we had there was <strong>last-minute. </strong>The students were going to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that's the adjective <strong>last</strong> plus the noun <strong>minute</strong>, joined with a hyphen. Now for another clip. Listen out for some more compound adjectives.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>A sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Well respected. </strong>That's an adverb, <strong>well</strong>, and the past participle of a verb, <strong>respected</strong>. And together, they make an adjective, and the two parts of the adjective need a hyphen when we write them before a noun.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's a<strong> well-respected politician</strong>, with a hyphen: <strong>well hyphen respected politician </strong>(well-respected politician).</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. But in a phrase like <strong>the politicians were well respected </strong>we don't use a hyphen, because the adjective comes after the noun, not before. And that rule is the same for three-word compound adjectives like <strong>out-of-date</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, the phrase<strong> out-of-date attitudes</strong> has hyphens because the adjective is before the noun, but the phrase <strong>their attitudes are out of date</strong> doesn't have hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And one last rule is that we never use hyphens in compound adjectives that have an adverb which ends in <strong>-l-y</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, we don't. So in phrases like<strong> a carefully written letter</strong> we don't use hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's talk about <strong>compound</strong> <strong>nouns</strong>. In our clip, Brian was reporting from a secondary school. The phrase <strong>s</strong><strong>econdary school</strong> is a compound noun - and there's no hyphen in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, there isn't. Most compound nouns are written as two separate words.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If you're not sure, check in a good dictionary. </p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Number one: What's the compound adjective in this sentence and does it need a hyphen? <strong>We were late because of the slow-moving traffic.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Slow-moving</strong> is the compound adjective, and it needs a hyphen.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Very good! And number two. Is there a hyphen in <strong>a forty-mile run</strong>? </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, there is. <strong>Forty hyphen mile run</strong> (forty-mile run)<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: <strong>The teacher was very well liked</strong>. Is there a hyphen in <strong>well liked</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We don't need a hyphen there.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done if you got those right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. When you are reading, make a note of compound adjectives and nouns with - and without - hyphens. Keep a list and check it regularly.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>  </strong><strong> <br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>In this programme we're talking about present tenses. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>Now let's get started. The first thing we need to know is that the present simple tense is mainly for facts, habits and truths. Now, Catherine, give me a true fact about you.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>A true fact about me is that I like gardening.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh, wow, great.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Love it.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Thanks Catherine. And can you tell me one of your habits?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>I drink a cup of coffee every morning. I drink one at home and I drink another one when I get to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So far so good. We make the present simple with a subject and base verb, and we add <strong>-s</strong> to the verb for <strong>he</strong>, <strong>she</strong> and <strong>it</strong>. So: I work, you work, he works, she works, and so on. We make questions and negatives with <strong>do</strong> or <strong>does</strong>. So Catherine, do you take milk in your coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>I do take milk in my coffee, Finn. Do you take milk in your coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>            <br/>I don't. I like it black.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And what about Mrs Finn, does she take milk in her coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She doesn't drink coffee.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, what does she drink?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Tea. All the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very British.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Good. So that's present simple for facts and habits. Now when we're talking about activities, temporary situations, and things that are happening now – or around now – we use <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is</strong> or <strong>are </strong>plus an <strong>i-n-g verb</strong> to make the present continuous. So Finn, what are you doing now?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, right now, right at this minute, I'm sitting in the studio, on a chair, talking to you, but off and on, I'm also reading a novel called The Unconsoled by Kazuo Ishiguro. It's great.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well pronounced.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Thank you. And are you reading anything right now Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes I am. I'm reading a novel also. It's a comedy about Adrian Mole and it's really good, I'm enjoying it a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Sounds great. I'd like to borrow it.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You can. We can also use the present continuous for future arrangements. So Finn, what are you doing tonight?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Tonight I'm taking my wife to dinner. Don't tell her.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Lucky wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right. So, present simple for facts and habits; present continuous for activities and future arrangements.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And now for the present perfect. We make it with <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> plus the past participle, it connects the past to the present, and it's useful for asking about life experiences. So, life experience question coming, Finn. Have you ever eaten insects?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>            <br/>I have, yes. I've eaten ants and beetles in Cambodia. So in the question, the word <strong>ever</strong> means 'at any time in your life'. <strong>Never</strong> means at no time in your life. So Catherine, tell us about an experience that you have <strong>never</strong> had. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I've never eaten insects Finn. And I've never been on safari. But I'm sure that our colleague Rob has been on safari.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He's been to many places.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>He has. Other words we use with present perfect are <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong>. We use <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong> a lot when we're using the present perfect tense to talk about the present effect of a past event. <strong>Already</strong> means something has happened, perhaps earlier than expected. So Finn, give us an example of <strong>already</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. I've <strong>already</strong> had breakfast today.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>And coffee? Have you had coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>I've <strong>just</strong> had a cup of coffee. <strong>Just</strong> means recently. I haven't had lunch <strong>yet</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I should think not, it's only half ten.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It's a bit early for lunch, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And <strong>yet</strong> means something like 'not until now'.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>Good. And if a past situation has continued until now, use <strong>for</strong> or <strong>since</strong> to say how long it has continued, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>I've lived in London <strong>for</strong> five years. I've been married <strong>since</strong> 2003.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We also use the present perfect to give news. Things that happened a short time ago, and are important now. So, have you got any news for us, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Yes I have, actually. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I've won the lottery!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I don't believe you.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's because I'm not telling the truth, it's just an example!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And we're talking about present tenses. And it's quiz time! Question one. Which of these sentences best describes a habit? a) I have smoked 20 cigarettes a day, b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And the answer's b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day. Question two. Is this sentence grammatically correct, or wrong? Humans have not visited the planet Mars yet, but they have already been to the moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It's correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It is. Now, last one: Which sentence is correct? a) Catherine has never eaten insects, b) Catherine never eats insects, or c) Catherine is never eating insects.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is that both a) and b) are correct. As a life experience it's true to say that I have never eaten insects; and as a fact I can say: I never eat insects. So that brings us to the end of the quiz, and well done to you if you got them all right.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>            <br/>A free insect for everyone who got all of those right!

Shops, <strong>warehouses</strong> and offices were left <strong>vacant</strong> when they stopped <strong>trading</strong>.</p>\n<p>But what happened to all these empty buildings? Here's an article on the pop-up <strong>craze </strong>in many towns and cities in the UK.</p>\n<p>While you're reading the first time, decide which is the best summary of the story.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-ups are shops that will save the high street.</li>\n<li>Pop-ups allow people freedom when they set up a business.</li>\n<li>Pop-ups have no risks when they are started.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Perfect pop-ups</h3>\n<p><strong>What is a 'pop-up'?</strong></p>\n<p>Pop-up shops first <strong>popped up</strong> in the UK in the early 2000s, with the economy <strong>booming</strong> and the high streets <strong>bustling</strong>. They were originally a way for small, <strong>niche</strong> companies to rent <strong>retail space</strong> in great locations. This was while <strong>landlords</strong> who owned these spaces looked for permanent <strong>tenants</strong>. Pop-up shops can take a number of different forms. They might be temporary shops in the high street or a shopping centre. They might be simple <strong>market stalls.</strong> They could be based in some kind of transport, like a food truck. Or they could be run by people who visit different establishments, like travelling chefs who take over pub and restaurant kitchens temporarily.</p>\n<p>Almost anything that can be on a high street can also be a pop-up. There have been pop-up shops, art galleries, theatres, cinemas and restaurants among others!</p>\n<p><strong>Why are pop-ups becoming so popular?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For <strong>would-be</strong> pop-up entrepreneurs, the appeal of this temporary shopping concept is clear. They can start a business with much lower risk. There are fewer <strong>overheads</strong>, such as paying wages or heating and lighting for their <strong>premises</strong>. The temporary nature of a pop-up gives the opportunity to test a product and develop a <strong>customer base</strong>, without being tied in to a long-term renting contract. Being small, with <strong>minimal</strong> staff, makes it much easier for pop-ups to <strong>expand</strong> if they are successful.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pop-up shops are a way for landlords to fill up empty property they may have. When the economy took a <strong>downturn</strong> after 2008, many shops became vacant after they <strong>went out of business</strong>. It makes sense for landlords to be able to allow people to come in and set up a temporary shop as a <strong>stopgap</strong> and use the available space.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you look at the business sector, pop-ups make a lot of sense. According to a 2014 report by the Centre of Economic and Business Research, the pop-up industry was worth £2.1bn and is expected to grow by 8.4% in 2015. Charles Davis of the CEBR also said that the pop-up sector \"is growing faster than the overall retail sector.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the future like for pop-up shops?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With banks remaining <strong>reluctant</strong> to lend money to new businesses and landlords still with lots of empty <strong>units</strong> to fill, there seems to be a future for pop-up shops in towns and city centres. There is also the threat of online shopping, which means that anyone can buy anything they want without leaving their home. If high streets all feature the same selection of shops, there is no variety. Pop-up shops add <strong>vibrancy</strong> to the high street and make it different and distinctive.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you work out which was the best summary of the article? Here is the answer:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-ups are shops that will save the high street. (No. Pop-ups can take many forms: shops, cinemas, restaurants and more. They might benefit the high street, but they might not save it completely.)</li>\n<li>Pop-ups allow people freedom when they set up a business. (Yes. Starting a pop-up can mean few overheads or expenses for the people who set them up.)</li>\n<li>Pop-ups have no risks when they are started. (No. Pop-ups might have a lower risk than traditional businesses, but there is still some risk.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Did you understand the article?

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Hi, this is Finn and I've got some special language for you today. And how about this: I might even save you some money! Learn English and save money? Well, today we're talking about haggling – now that's what we do when we're trying to buy something for a cheaper price – like at a market, or on holiday.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Haggling is, of course, very common in many different cultures, and here in the UK people do haggle but they don't really do it in big shops: you might hear it, maybe, at a market – or, as we're going to hear – if you're buying something expensive like a second-hand car.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Now, Rob is looking for a good deal. But will Neil – who's selling – be happy with the price? Let's listen. And while you do, listen out for a particular phrase – instead of saying 'could you sell it for...', what does Rob say?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Excuse me. How much for the Vauxhall over there?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Oh the Vauxhall, oh yeah, that's a <strong>bargain.</strong> £700. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>700?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Yeah. It'll cost you at least 800 anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>Could you do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>500? No, sorry, no: I can sell this car for 700, I'm sure of it.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I've got the cash. <strong>You couldn't do it for 550?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>No. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do a bit cheaper, could you?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Well, I tell you what, <strong>I could probably do it for about 650.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Ok, let's pause their haggling right there. Did you hear the phrase Rob used? Instead of saying 'Could you sell it for £500', Rob said:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/></span></span><span><span><strong>Could you do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Do it. Simple, huh? <strong>Could you</strong> <strong>do it for</strong> <strong>500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>Could you</strong> <strong>do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>You could also say <strong>Can you do it for</strong> <strong>£500</strong> – <strong>can</strong> rather than <strong>could.</strong> But <strong>could</strong> is a little bit more polite. Now listen to these examples of it as well – you can use it in the negative, with <strong>couldn't:</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do it for</strong> <strong>550? </strong></span></span><span><span><strong>You couldn't do it a</strong> <strong>bit cheaper, could you?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do it for 550? You couldn't do a bit cheaper, could you?</strong> Now remember, haggling goes both ways – and the seller will use lots of language to keep the price high. So did you notice the language Neil used – he called it a <strong>bargain</strong> – that's a good price, and said it would cost more in other shops.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Oh the Vauxhall, oh yeah, that's a <strong>bargain</strong>. £700. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>700?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It'll cost you at least 800 anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>But Rob is persistent – he doesn't give up! He's succeeded in getting the price down by £50 already. You could say – Neil has <strong>knocked off</strong> £50. Now, <strong>knocked off</strong> means he's taken the price down by £50. Now, let's listen to the end of their conversation – the end of their haggling. How much does Neil <strong>knock off</strong> in the end?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>I tell you what, <strong>I could probably do it for about 650.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>650?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>650, yeah. <strong>You can't say fairer than that.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Well, is that really your best price?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It's my best price. 650. Come on.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I've got all the cash here. I haven’t got 650, I've got 600. I'll give you 600 for it.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>630, how about that? I've just <strong>knocked off</strong> another £20.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>It's too much: <strong>I haven’t got that kind of money</strong>. Look, I saw it down the road for 600. In fact, I think I might go there and buy it. Thanks anyway, bye.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Hang on, hang on, let's not be <strong>silly</strong> here. Let's not be silly here. I'll tell you what. 600.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>600. It's a deal.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>So how much did Neil <strong>knock off</strong>? Well the final price was £600, and it started at £700 – so he <strong>knocked off</strong> £100. How did Rob do this? Well, he used another good phrase: <strong>I haven’t got that kind of money.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/></span></span><span><span>It's too much: <strong>I haven’t got that kind of money</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>And he also did something I always do if I'm haggling and I can't get the price down – he started to walk away.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I saw it down the road for 600. In fact, I think I might go there and buy it. Thanks anyway, bye.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Hang on, hang on...</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>It's a bit naughty, isn't it - but it tends to work! Anyway, finally they reached a deal. And what did Neil say at the very end?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>600.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>600. It's a deal.</p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong> You'll often hear this in spoken English – in a haggling situation like this, so if you hear it, well done – your haggling has been successful, and it's time to pay up!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong><br/>600.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/></span></span><span><span>600. It's a deal.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>That's it for this time, but let me know if you manage to use any of this language next time you haggle. You might even save some money. I'll leave you with their conversation one last time.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Excuse me. How much for the Vauxhall over there?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Oh the Vauxhall, oh yeah, that's a <strong>bargain.</strong> £700. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>700?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It'll cost you at least 800 anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>Could you do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>500? No, sorry, no: I can sell this car for 700, I'm sure of it.<br/></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I've got the cash. <strong>You couldn't do it for 550?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>No. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do a bit cheaper, could you?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>I'll tell you what, <strong>I could probably do it for 650.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>650?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>650, yeah. <strong>You can't say fairer than that.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Well, is that really your best price?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It's my best price. 650.

We use it with <strong>can/can't</strong> and <strong>could/couldn't</strong>:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>I <strong>can</strong> probably <strong>do it for</strong> about £650.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><span><span><strong><em>Can't</em></strong><em> you <strong>do it a bit cheaper</strong>?</em></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><strong><em>Could</em></strong><em> you <strong>do it for </strong>500?</em></span></span></li>\n<li><em><span><span>You <strong>couldn't do it</strong> <strong>for</strong> £550?</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>2. </span></strong><strong><span><span>To 'knock off'</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span><span>This phrasal verb means 'lower the price'.</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>Can you <strong>knock off</strong> another £30?</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>I could <strong>knock off</strong> £10 for you.</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span><strong>3. When you've got a deal:</strong> <strong>'Go on then'</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>To show that the price is agreed, it sounds very natural in spoken English for the buyer and/or the seller to say: <strong>Go on then</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>Buyer: £600?</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>Seller: <strong>Go on then</strong>.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>Buyer: I'll give you £40 for it.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>Seller: <strong>Go on then</strong>.</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Next</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span></span>Now – can you use these expressions to haggle? Let's find out in the next activity, as you try to buy a camera at a bargain price.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Can you do it a bit cheaper?</h3>\n<p>Learning about haggling would be no fun without the chance to practise! So, now it's time to put our haggling language to good use.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong></strong>To do</h3>\n<p>Imagine you're at a pop-up market and you've seen a camera you really like. It's a vintage one - very stylish! All your friends will be jealous. But first, you have to buy it - and the seller wants too much. He wants £100, but you only want to spend £50. Answer the questions in our haggling quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>Well done: you're now a professional haggler! That's all for this session.

I'm Neil...</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>A very smart Neil - and I'm Catherine. Why are you wearing a suit, Neil? You're looking very smart for work.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes you're right, I am wearing a suit because I'm going to a wedding<strong> at one o'clock</strong>!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! I love weddings.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I love weddings too. I'm going to another one <strong>on Saturday</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Fantastic Neil. And<strong> at </strong>and <strong>on</strong> are two of the words we’re discussing in today's programme...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, because we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We'll explain why we say <strong><span>at</span></strong> <strong>one o'clock </strong>but <strong><span>on</span> Saturday.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span>    <br/>Yes, and we'll give you lots of examples.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Let's start by listening to Mike and Rob. They are trying to find a time to meet up.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Think about this question while you listen: what time can Rob meet Mike?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well... I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hmm... the engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. The washing machine's flooded <span>again!</span> It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Well, what are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sorry - I'm playing football.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend. </strong>How about this afternoon <strong>at two thirty</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So, we asked you: What time can Rob meet Mike? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: <strong>at two thirty.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>When we say a particular time on the clock, we use <strong>at</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, we say <strong>at two thirty, at three o'clock.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>at</strong> in other time expressions. Listen out for them in this clip.  </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 1       </strong><span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well… I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hmm… The engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. The washing machine's flooded <span>again!</span> It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So Rob had a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong>It's<strong> at </strong>because it’s a time<strong>. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. We also heard <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. We use <strong>at</strong> with particular points during the day, like mealtimes, so it's <strong>at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and also we say <strong>at noon</strong>,<strong> at midnight</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now Rob said his washing machine flooded <strong>at Easter</strong>. We use <strong>at</strong> to talk about a special day or group of days. So, it’s<strong> at Easter, at New Year.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>At Christmas. So that's <strong>at</strong>. Let’s look at <strong>on</strong>. We use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week. So: <strong>on Monday,</strong> <strong>on Tuesday</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>on</strong> with specific dates: <strong>on the third of May, on June the 20th</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and we use <strong>on</strong> with specific days: <strong>on Christmas Day, on Easter Sunday, on my birthday</strong>!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But remember it's<strong> <span>at</span> Easter, <span>at</span> Christmas </strong>when we are referring to the general time period.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen to another clip with more time expressions. Listen out for the time expression with <strong>in</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2</span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>What are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sorry - I'm playing football.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend. </strong>How about this afternoon<strong> at two thirty?</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>in the afternoon</strong>. We use <strong>in</strong> with parts of the day, so it's <strong>in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>But did you notice that it's<strong> on Saturday evening. </strong>If we use a day of the week plus <strong>morning, afternoon</strong> or <strong>evening, </strong>we use <strong>on</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>in</strong> with seasons, so it's<strong> in spring, in the winter. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>in</strong> with months and years, so it's <strong>in June, in 1996.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>Notice also that Rob said <strong>at the weekend</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Rob speaks British English so he used <strong>at the weekend</strong>. Some other speakers will say <strong>on the weekend</strong>. It's perfectly fine.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, to recap, we use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week, dates and special days.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use<strong> at </strong>with times and particular points in the day.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>British people say <strong>at the weekend. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we also say <strong>at</strong> with festivals<strong>.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>in</strong> for seasons, months and years. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And now for a quiz.

And what's Mike doing <strong>in the afternoon</strong>?</p>\n<p>In 6 Minute Vocabulary we're looking at time expressions with the words <strong>in, at</strong> and <strong>on.</strong> Neil and Catherine are your guides - and they have lots of top tips to help you remember.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-2/downloads\" target=\"_self\">Unit 2 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/6min_vocab\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, do you think you know how to use <strong>in, at</strong> and <strong>on</strong> with time expressions now? Would you like a chance to demonstrate your ability? Well, try the activities on the next two pages.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Time to show off your knowledge</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to test how well you understood the rules about using <strong>in</strong>, <strong>on</strong> and <strong>at</strong> with time expressions. We want you to complete a conversation between two friends. Misha and Surya live in different countries and haven't seen each other for a long time. Misha is thinking about visiting Surya at her home in the mountains.</p>\n<h3> </h3></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Fill the gaps with the correct prepositions. Also, while you read, try to answer this question: When does Misha decide to fly?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>How did you get on? If you didn't get them all right, have another try. And do you know when Misha decided to fly? It was on Friday 3rd April at 7pm.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done for completing that quiz. Those time expressions were quite simple - but what about time expressions with two parts - like <strong>Saturday morning</strong>? Do we say <strong>at</strong>,<strong> in</strong> or <strong>on</strong>? Find out and then do another quiz, next!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Some extra tips</h3>\n<p>So, you've done one activity about <strong>in</strong>,<strong> at</strong>, and <strong>on</strong>. But what about when things are not so clear?</p>\n<h3> </h3></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Tip 1 - On Saturday night</strong></h3>\n<p>Look at this sentence. Should <strong>in, on</strong> or <strong>at</strong> go in the gap?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We're meeting __ Saturday night.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We would normally say <strong>on</strong> Saturday and <strong>at</strong> night. So should it be <strong>on</strong> – for Saturday – or <strong>at</strong> – for night? The answer is:</p>\n<p>We're meeting <strong>on</strong> Saturday night.</p>\n<p>We use the preposition <strong>on</strong> even though there is another time expression afterwards.</p>\n<h3>Tip 2 - On Christmas morning</h3>\n<p>Why do you think we use <strong>on</strong> in this sentence?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What did you do <strong>on Christmas morning</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Normally we use <strong>at</strong> for festivals like Christmas and we use <strong>in</strong> for parts of the day like the morning, but Christmas Day is actually a specific day, rather than a whole festival, so we use <strong>on</strong>. Again, we use the preposition <strong>on</strong> even though there is another time expression afterwards.</p>\n<h3>Tip 3 - No preposition</h3>\n<p>Finally, <strong>in</strong>, <strong>at</strong> and <strong>on</strong> are not generally used before the words <strong>today, tomorrow </strong>and<strong> yesterday</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't go <strong>tomorrow</strong></li>\n<li>He wrote that article <strong>yesterday</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't use <strong>in, on</strong> or <strong>at</strong> in time expressions with the words <strong>this, that, next, last, all, one, each, some and every:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I slept<strong> all day</strong></li>\n<li>He didn't come<strong> last night</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now, use the information from the whole of this session to answer the questions in this quiz. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session.

It started raining in the morning, continued raining and it’s still raining now.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We can also use the present perfect continuous for actions that have recently finished. An example, please Finn.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I’ve got paint all over my clothes because I’ve been decorating the living room.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, so Finn's got paint all over his clothes, and that's the evidence he was painting but now he's finished. Another example please, Finn:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Joe! Where have you been? I’ve been trying to get hold of you… I’ve got some bad news.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So, Finn has finally managed to find Joe. The action of looking for Joe has finished but Finn was looking right up until the moment he found him. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>To say how long an action has been happening for, we can add a time expression.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Jack has got a big concert tomorrow. He’s been rehearsing <strong>all day</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>We’ve been going to the same hotel<strong> for the last ten years</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Earlier, Finn said: it has been raining<strong> since 9 o’clock this morning</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>For three hours, for the last ten years </strong>and<strong> since 9 o’clock this morning</strong> tell us how long the activity has been happening. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The present perfect continuous is often used with the words <strong>already</strong> and <strong>just</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, we can use <strong>already </strong>if an action hasn’t finished, and we want to emphasise how long it’s been happening. Finn:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>She’s <strong>alread</strong>y been sleeping for three hours.</span></p>\n<p><span>This chicken has <strong>already</strong> been cooking for two hours.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>just</strong> when the action has already finished - and we want to emphasise how recently it finished.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There’s Yasemin – I’ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband on the phone!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We can also use <strong>recently </strong>or <strong>lately</strong> to say that a situation or action finished only a short while ago, but they are a little further back in time than <strong>just</strong>. So, Neil, have you been doing anything special recently…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I’ve been trying to lose a bit of weight recently, so I’ve been going to the gym after work. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>It's starting to show a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. How about you, Catherine…?</p>\n<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, I’m afraid I haven't been going to the gym because I’ve been feeling rather tired lately and I haven’t been sleeping very well.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You’ve been working too hard! Now, we form the present perfect continuous with the <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb. Here are some examples:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Jack has been working hard.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s been raining …</span></p>\n<p><span>I’ve been reading that book …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And for negatives, it’s <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>haven’t</strong> or <strong>hasn’t </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I haven’t been sleeping very well.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We usually put <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> between <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong>. So it’s She’s <strong>already</strong> been sleeping for three hours.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>…</strong>and I’ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband ….</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>But time expressions usually go after the main verb. So it’s Jack’s been studying <strong>all day</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And don’t forget to use short forms like <strong>I’ve… It’s… haven’t… hasn’t </strong>with the present perfect continuous.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine <br/></span></strong><span>And we're talking about the present perfect continuous. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We use it to talk about an activity that started in the past and is continuing now or has recently finished.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we often use it with the adverbs <strong>just </strong>and<strong> already</strong>, and with other time expressions like <strong>recently</strong> and<strong> lately</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Time for our quiz. Number one. Which is correct? The chicken only needs another fifteen minutes. It's a) …already been cooking for two hours, or b) It’s just been cooking for two hours. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And that's a) because the chicken is still cooking.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number 2. a) Where have you been? I wait for you for half an hour. b) Where have you been? I’ve been waiting for you for half an hour. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It’s b) because you use the present perfect continuous to say how long you have been doing an action. </p>\n<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Finally, number 3. a) You’ve been listening just to 6 minute grammar. b) You’ve just been listening to 6 minute grammar.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>It’s b) because <strong>just</strong> goes between the auxiliary <strong>have</strong> and <strong>been</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Correct and it’s the end of the show. There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

Or do you think they are a bit <strong>past it</strong>?</p>\n<p>If you think they are not as good as they used to be, you may not be alone. Some people think the <strong>format</strong> needs a big <strong>shake-up</strong> and are looking for alternatives to the traditional panel of judges. Scientists at the University of Sussex think they have come up with a solution - and you can read more about it in this article.</p>\n<p>While you're reading, try to decide which of these is the best summary of the story:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A computer program might replace TV talent show judges.</li>\n<li>Computers can match the performance of human judges.</li>\n<li>A team from America is making computerised talent show judges.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Talent shows: from human judges to computers</h3>\n<p>Most of us will be familiar with the traditional talent show set up: thousands of <strong>hopefuls</strong> lining up outside the audition room, ready for their shot at stardom. After they have been waiting for hours and hours, they go in and perform for a <strong>panel</strong> of judges. Then these <strong>wannabe</strong> popstars could be lucky and get through to the next round, or they might hear the line, \"Sorry, it's a 'no' from me\". But what do the judges actually bring to a talent show?</p>\n<p>Music talent show judges attract millions of viewers each week to their programmes. Their high public profile can make them an important part of advertising campaigns for these programmes. But they often receive high salaries and can be <strong>temperamental</strong>. Are they really worth the expense and difficulties that they can cause? One solution might be to replace them with computers.</p>\n<p>Can computers really match human judges, with their general musical knowledge and <strong>ear for </strong>a tune? Scientist Dr Nick Collins and his team at the University of Sussex think they can. Dr Collings has been working on a project that involves programming three computerised judges that he says would be far more <strong>consistent</strong> in their judgement of musical performances. Using a highly <strong>versatile programming language</strong>, Dr Collins's digital judges can be trained up by 'listening' to particular musical <strong>genres</strong>. After they have been listening for a while, the programming language allows these judges to spot the specific features of the music. It takes eight hours to train the electronic judges in this way. During this time they analyse lots of information about each track they listen to, including the pitch, the <strong>timbre</strong> of the music, the rhythm and the way the tracks change over time.</p>\n<p>Collins even says that the \"judges also have <strong>pet hates</strong> and <strong>guilty pleasures</strong>\" and that he \"can't anticipate how they will turn out\". He adds, \"The judges' listening capacity is not yet <strong>on a par with</strong> a human ear\" but that they won't be as annoying as some human reality TV show judges.</p>\n<p>And maybe that is the problem with this electronic musical innovation. Real human judges on talent shows interest us with their personality, decisions and <strong>catchphrases</strong>. Will a computer program be able to do the same?</p>\n<p>For more information about these computer talent show judges, you can read this <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17735551\" target=\"_self\">original BBC News story</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>So, did you work out which was the best summary of the article?</strong></p>\n<p>It was 'A computer program might replace TV talent show judges.' You can find out why the other possible summaries were wrong in our quiz.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>How well did you understand the article?

Here's Colin.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Colin<br/></strong></span><span>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>! Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>? How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad? Do you need to get some <strong>advice</strong> from your bank? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport? </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that was Colin. We asked you: What might you need from your bank before you go abroad?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And the answer is: You might need some <strong>advice</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right: <strong>some advice</strong>.<strong> Advice</strong> means ideas and suggestions about what to do. Now, did you notice that <strong>advice </strong>is not plural? We never say <strong>advices</strong> in English because <strong>advice</strong> is an uncountable noun. You can't make <strong>advice</strong> plural, like you can in some other languages.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And with uncountable nouns, we don't use articles <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong>. We say <strong>some advice</strong>, not<strong> an advice</strong>. Now listen out for three more uncountable nouns in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Colin<br/></strong></span>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>! Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>?</p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the uncountable nouns in that clip were: <strong>travel, research</strong> and <strong>accommodation</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And activities like <strong>travel, work</strong> and <strong>homework</strong> are usually uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Information words like <strong>research</strong>,<strong> information</strong> and <strong>advice</strong> are uncountable too. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they're not usually plural in English, but we can add the words <strong>a piece of </strong>to lots of uncountable nouns if we like. So we can say <strong>a piece of information </strong>or<strong> two pieces of advice.  </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. The other uncountable noun in that clip was <strong>accommodation</strong>.<strong> Accommodation </strong>means 'places to live or spend the night', like rooms, flats and houses. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>accommodation</strong> describes the groups of places that you can stay like flats, houses, students halls of residence. And group words are often uncountable, so there's no plural form. <strong>Fruit</strong>,<strong> food</strong> and <strong>weather</strong> are group words too. We don't usually say <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>foods</strong> and <strong>weathers</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>That's right. Now, let's have another clip. Can you spot any more uncountable nouns?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>baggage</strong>,<strong> money </strong>and<strong> traffic</strong>. In some languages these words are often plural...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>...but not in English. In English, they are all group words.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. So<strong> baggage </strong>means a group of bags...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's<strong> money </strong>for coins or notes...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>traffic</strong> for cars, lorries, buses.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we're talking about uncountable nouns. We've seen that some activity nouns are uncountable, and some group nouns are uncountable. Shall we now talk about more types of uncountable nouns, Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Go on then. So we've got liquids and gases. <strong>Water</strong> and <strong>air </strong>are uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they are. Materials and substances like <strong>wood </strong>and <strong>salt</strong> are uncountable too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Then there are words for feelings and ideas, so <strong>happiness</strong> and <strong>education</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And also subjects like <strong>history</strong> and <strong>biology</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But be careful with subjects like <strong>physics</strong> or <strong>economics</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they end with the letter <strong>-s,</strong> so they look plural, but in fact they're usually uncountable too. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So we use them with a singular verb, just like other uncountable nouns. Physics <strong>is</strong> complicated...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>...and Economics <strong>isn't</strong> easy.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/><strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it's quiz time! Number one: Is the word <strong>furniture</strong> countable or uncountable?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is - it's uncountable. It's a group word like <strong>baggage</strong>. It means things like tables and chairs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Very good. And number two: is this sentence correct or wrong? Please can you give me some informations?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>That is not correct. <strong>Information</strong> is uncountable so it's <strong>some information</strong> without an -<strong>s</strong>, not <strong>some informations</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine.<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! And the last one: Which is correct: a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday. Or b) it was a beautiful weather on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The answer's a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done to you if you got them all right.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But before we go, here's a tip. When you see a noun, think carefully about whether it belongs to one of these types: activity words, information words or group words. If it does, then it's probably uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme we're talking about the words <strong>all, every, each, both, either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...also known as quantifiers. So let's start by listening to Darren. He's been talking about how to choose a tablet.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Why do customers have difficulty choosing a tablet?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT <br/></strong><strong>Darren<br/></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one? <strong>All</strong> customers choosing a tablet ask themselves that question because <strong>each</strong> tablet is slightly different. Take the Apik 1 and the Negus 2. <strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter. This could make a difference <strong>every </strong>time you go out. <strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. And then there’s the cost. While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That was Darren. So we asked you: Why do buyers have difficulty choosing tablets?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: Because <strong>each</strong> tablet has slightly different features.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now <strong>each</strong>,<strong> every</strong> and <strong>all</strong> can mean the full amount or total number of something. So we could also say <strong>every tablet </strong>or <strong>all tablets</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Each</strong> and <strong>every </strong>are followed by a singular noun and verb. We say <strong>each tablet has </strong>and<strong> every tablet</strong> <strong>has</strong> - but <strong>all</strong> is followed by a plural noun and verb, so it’s <strong>all tablets have</strong>. We could also say <strong>all the tablets have</strong>, but we don’t use <strong>the</strong> with <strong>each</strong> or <strong>every</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. There’s also a slight difference in meaning between <strong>every</strong> and <strong>each</strong>. We often use <strong>each</strong> when we're thinking about the individual members of a group.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. So to talk about about the features of individual tablets, Darren said <strong>each tablet</strong>. But here's what he said later on.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Darren<br/></strong>This could make a difference <strong>every time</strong> you go out.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There he's thinking about all the times, not individual times.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Listen for more quantifiers in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Darren      <br/></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one? <strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There we heard the words <strong>either</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>, or as some people say, <strong>either</strong>, <strong>neither</strong>, and <strong>both.</strong> We use these quantifiers to talk about two people or things. So in the phrase <strong>Both tablets have similar specs, Both tablets</strong> means <strong>this tablet and the other tablet</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>Neither tablet is heavy</strong>. That means <strong>not this one and not the other one</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Darren asked: <strong>Should you have either this one or that one?</strong> <strong>Either</strong> is used mainly in questions and negatives, to indicate a choice between two, or sometimes more than two, options.  </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Let's take a quick look at the verbs we use after <strong>both</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>. Listen. <strong>Both the tablets have </strong>similar specs. <strong>Neither tablet is </strong>heavy.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So after <strong>both</strong>, the verb is positive and plural – <strong>have</strong>. But after <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>, the verb is positive and singular - <strong>is</strong>. Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Darren<br/></strong><strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we heard<strong> each of the tablets </strong>and<strong> neither of them. </strong>You can use<strong> all</strong>,<strong> each</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>,<strong> either </strong>and<strong> both </strong>with <strong>of</strong> and a plural noun phrase – like <strong>the tablets</strong> – or with a pronoun – like <strong>them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. So you could say <strong>both of the tablets</strong> or <strong>both of them</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes and in this case,<strong> each of the tablets </strong>means the same as<strong> both of the tablets. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Because there are only two.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But we say <strong>each of the tablets has</strong> - that’s a singular verb - but <strong>both of the tablets have </strong>- and that's a plural verb.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's quiz time!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number one: Which is correct: a) Both of us lives in London. Or b) Both of us live in London.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is b) Both of us live in London.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And let's do number two: Which is correct? a) Neither of us likes the countryside. Or b) Neither of us doesn't like the countryside.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>This one… is a) Neither of us likes the countryside.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: Which is correct? a) Answer each questions. Or b) Answer each of the questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The answer is b). Answer each of the questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Fantastic! And that's the end of the quiz.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Quantifiers</h3>\n<p>In this session we look at the words <strong>all</strong>, <strong>each</strong>, <strong>every</strong>, <strong>both</strong>, <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>. We call them <strong>quantifiers:</strong> words that give us information about the number or amount of something. Other examples of quantifiers are some, more, less, most, enough and several. In this unit we're looking at what happens when they're followed by nouns.</p>\n<p>So first, let's examine <strong>all</strong>, <strong>each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>. If you're studying at this level then you'll know these words already. You'll know they mean the whole number of something in a group. But what are the differences?</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Answer the questions to help you work out the differences in form, meaning and use between these three words. The questions are about the topic of student accommodation.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>How did you do? We hope you got them <strong>all </strong>right! Here are the answers again, for your reference.</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>All</strong> or <strong>All the</strong> is followed by a plural or uncountable noun. <strong>Every</strong> and <strong>each</strong> are followed by a singular noun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All the students</strong> have their own rooms.</li>\n<li><strong>All the information</strong> about accommodation is on our website.</li>\n<li><strong>Every student</strong> has their own room.</li>\n<li><strong>Each student</strong> has their own room.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) </strong> <strong>Every </strong>and <strong>each </strong>can often be used in the same place, but we prefer <strong>every</strong> when we are thinking about the whole number in a group, and <strong>each</strong> when we are thinking about the members of the group as individuals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Every room</strong> has Wi-Fi. <strong>Each one</strong> has a different view.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> To emphasise the individual members of a group, use <strong>every</strong> not <strong>each</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was too late to apply for accommodation. <strong>Every room</strong> in the building is already taken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> For only two things, we can use <strong>each</strong> but not <strong>every</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The university has two student dormitories, with about 1,000 students in <strong>each building</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5) All </strong>and <strong>each</strong> but not <strong>every</strong> can be followed by <strong>of</strong> <strong>+ a plural noun or pronoun</strong><em>.</em> Notice that <strong>each of</strong> with a plural noun or pronoun is followed by a singular verb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All of the students have</strong> a phone in the room.</li>\n<li><strong>Each of them has</strong> a phone in their room.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, those are the rules for <strong>all</strong>, <strong>each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>. Look out for them in sentences you read in English - especially the difference between <strong>each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>. Next, we'll look at three more quantifiers: <strong>both</strong>, <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>More quantifiers</h3>\n<p>Now let's look at the quantifiers <strong>both</strong>, <strong>either</strong>, and <strong>neither </strong>with nouns.

Some people say that having more money makes life much easier, but others say that it can't buy you happiness. What do you think? Here's an article about the possible link between our finances and our feelings.</p>\n<p>While you're reading, decide which of these two statements is the best summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money helps us do a lot of things but it can't make our lives get better forever.</li>\n<li>Money makes our lives get better and better all the time.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>More money might not mean more happiness</h3>\n<p>Would you have the kind of reaction you can see in this picture if you were suddenly given a lot of money? It might seem greedy to want all this cash, but for some people there is nothing better than holding a <strong>wodge</strong> of <strong>notes</strong>. For them, life with money is much easier. Paying bills, eating in <strong>fancy</strong> restaurants, buying expensive <strong>luxury</strong> <strong>items</strong> – these are all things you can do if you have the money. You don't have to worry about paying the rent every month. Each time you need to replace something in your home, like a washing machine – no problem, you can pay for it. Money does make life easier in some ways.</p>\n<p>But money does not always equal happiness in every situation. There are places in the world where people don't have much money, but they are still happy. They <strong>make do</strong> with what they have and don't need money to buy expensive things. And in the past, money wasn't seen as the key to happiness. For example, parents wouldn’t buy expensive toys for their children. Instead, the children were <strong>content</strong> to play with things they found, like sticks and stones in the garden.</p>\n<p>Today in the developed world however, money might <strong>be central to</strong> our happiness. Having to pay more and more for things means we place more and more value on each coin and note in our pockets. So, the amount we earn in our jobs becomes <strong>crucial</strong> to our opinions about happiness. When we earn more, we feel happier. When countries become <strong>wealthier</strong>, there is usually improvement in education, lower <strong>child mortality</strong>, and longer <strong>life expectancy</strong>. The problem with this is that there is only so much of these things that money can buy. Things can't <strong>keep on</strong> getting better continuously.</p>\n<p>And is there a point at which money can make us <strong>decidedly</strong> unhappy? For example, high-paid jobs often come with a lot of stress. There is only so much pressure you can take before you might need to quit <strong>the rat race</strong>, however good the pay is. Not to mention that it is very difficult, maybe almost impossible, to define what happiness actually is.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you work out which was the best summary?</strong></p>\n<p>It was: Money helps us do a lot of things but it can't make our lives get better forever.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Are you happy? Time for a quiz. See if you get all the questions right.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session. Join us in Session 4 where you'll hear all about the 'stuffocation' of society. Do we have too much stuff?</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Chris Evans</strong><br>Define 'stuffocation' for us please, James.</br></p>\n<p><strong>James Wallman<br/></strong>Too much stuff. It's that feeling, Chris, when you go to your wardrobe, you open up the doors, and it's full of things that you could wear but there's nothing you actually want to put on. Or you go to a cupboard and you have to <strong>root around</strong> through loads of things that you never even use to find the one thing you actually need at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Evans<br/></strong>But we know that don't we? We do know that anyway. But you take it a lot further: you say that stuff can kill you, almost? </p>\n<p><strong>James Wallman<br/></strong>Well, the thing is, <strong>materialism</strong> and the <strong>consumer revolution</strong>… Best idea of the 20th Century: so all of the stuff we are into, buying lots of stuff gave people lots of great jobs and it <strong>transforms</strong> standards of living in the 20th Century. So it was a great idea: it solved the problem of <strong>scarcity</strong> but it's given us the problem of <strong>abundance</strong>. So much stuff that it's causing stress and anxiety and depression in record levels and that point about 'too much stuff can kill you' comes from a study from some psychologists did in Los Angeles that found, in particular for women, that for women who had too much stuff in their home and talked about too much stuff in their home, had this <strong>signature pattern</strong> of something called cortisol, which is the pattern that people have who have <strong>post-traumatic stress disorder</strong>, <strong>chronic fatigue</strong> and a higher risk of <strong>mortality</strong>. So it's not quite a kind of 'too much stuff will kill you' but there is a very close kind of <strong>correlation</strong>, too much stuff, in a headline, will lead you to an earlier <strong>grave</strong>.</p>\n<p>I think one of the interesting things about the book, and the idea of stuffocation, is just that we can all relate to it. If you mention stuffocation to people, everyone has got a story, everyone has got too much stuff. We've all got too much stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Evans<br/></strong>So what's the answer?</p>\n<p><strong>James Wallman<br/></strong>The answer is doing things. For me it's what I call 'experientialism'. Instead of thinking that were going to find happiness, identity, <strong>status</strong> and meaning in things, in stuff, I think we're going to find the best place to find happiness, identity, status and meaning is in experiences instead.<span> </span></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Can having too much harm your health?</h3>\n<p>In this session we hear an interview with a British author who believes that having too many things is very bad for us. James Wallman thinks that having so much stuff makes us <strong>suffocate</strong> - or as he calls it - 'stuffocate'.</p>\n<p>So how much is too much? And what can we do about it?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to BBC presenter Chris Evans interview James Wallman, then answer questions which will test your understanding and help you practise quantifiers. Also ask yourself: what is James's solution to stuffocation?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The solution to too much stuff?</h3>\n<p>James Wallman said that we can only feel truly happy by having experiences, not by buying more things.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>What do you think about this? Do you agree with James? Or do you think that having a lot of things is good? On the next page, it's your chance to let us know your thoughts.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Your turn</h3>\n<p>James Wallman thinks we have too much stuff in our lives, and that this can damage our health. Maybe he would prefer a home like the one in the picture below? But what about you?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you have too much stuff? Is it making you sad and upset? Or maybe shopping for new things makes you feel happy... Write down your thoughts in fewer than 100 words, and remember to use as many quantifiers as you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all</li>\n<li>some</li>\n<li>a few</li>\n<li>a bit of</li>\n<li>too much</li>\n<li>too many</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Mercedes, Spain</h3>\n<p>It is difficult to balance when it comes to acquiring objects or things that are needed.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to buy something then you have to book for future use, for example everything related to bricolage (drills, screwdrivers...).</p>\n<p>On the other hand we all have predilection for some type of object you appreciate more than another. In this case we acquired for enjoyment, such as collect something.</p>\n<p>In my case I am aware of buying a lot of books and I think some will not have time to read them.</p>\n<p>Time passes and there is much to do. </p>\n<h3>Maria</h3>\n<p>I check my wardrobe every season and set aside the clothes that are no longer in fashion, but  it's not easy to choose  and I always pick a few items that I know do not wear any more, then I buy new clothes so my wardrobe is always too full.</p>\n<p>In the kitchen I have some kitchenware that I never use; a colander, ladles, large pots but I don't like to throw them out.</p>\n<p>After reading the article by Wallman I plan to get rid of some of my stuff and give away a litte of everything superfluous.</p>\n<h3>Fábio, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I think that stuff is one problem of the global world and of our civilization/society. People feel happy when buy new objects, too many objects as possible. There is psychological comfort with this. The marketing of the stores for the products/objects increase this psychological comfort and people loves and loves to buy. I think that one solution for this kind of psychological comfort is living with what we need have and not live with we want to show. Today people lives to show instead of only to lives.</p>\n<h3>Kamilla</h3>\n<p>I think too much stuff don't make you happy.</p>\n<p>I have relatives, they have a lot of stuff at home, many beautiful and expensive things. But it's a main problem to live house for several days!!!! Because they always worry about things at home, they worry about that thiefs can steal it when home be alone. They worry about fire, floods, thiefs, e.t.c. And it's devastating!!! People might have few stuff and be happy! I think happiness in knowledges, in traveling, freedom. It's individual things if you want to be closed in your house buy much stuff and be happy! But remember you don't buy all stuff in the world! </p>\n<h3>Nguyễn</h3>\n<p>My opinion is different from Mr. Wallman's. I think that we should put stuff in the right place that we can find it easily when necessary. It not only makes our house look much better, but it also allows us to find the things we need in some situations. Having much stuff is necessary because you may need it in the future. For instance, you have many cups although you live alone. But some day, many friends of you come and you have enough cups for them to use.</p>\n<h3>Filippo</h3>\n<p>As far as I'm concerned, each person realize to have too much stuff as time goes by; in fact I've stopped to buy things less useful or in general anything I liked, in occasion of the new birth of my baby.</p>\n<p>When I was child I asked my parents to buy always new games, however sometimes they bought me, sometimes no... right now I've understood the reason.</p>\n<p>I would like to spend my time to realize too many experiences with both my baby and my wife taking too many photos just because unnecessary stuff doesn't remain impress in our life, photos does.</p>\n<p>According to James Wallman, we can only feel happy by having experiences... and photos...</p>\n<h3>Matthieu</h3>\n<p>It is obvious there is to many things in my house. Moreover, since I am student in Paris, all the members of my family put some things they don't need in my room, so it is now a merry mess, where my huge collection of books and comics meets old toys of my sister and my mother's twenty-years-old school books.</p>\n<p>Oddly, I don't feel any lose of breathe surrounded by all this unnecessary furniture and I love both my wood cat and my cactus which are as useless as funny.</p>\n<p>I will be sad when I will soon have to leave this capernaum to my empty student room...</p>\n<h3>Naoki</h3>\n<p>Immediately, so many things filled up my new house.</p>\n<p>First, my room had only few furnitures and there was a large empty space. That made me feel uncomfortable and stressed so I wanted to buy things fill my room and my mind. However, as the room got narrower, I felt sick and suffocated.</p>\n<p>I think neither having too many things nor having very few things are good for us, but too much stuff is worse than the latter one as it makes me much more stressful.</p>\n<p>To grab happiness, we should know how much stuff comforts us the most.</p>\n<h3>Regina, Brasil</h3>\n<p>I don't know when I started to mind about the quantities of stuff there were in the world. I started by my room fills of many things, sometimes I didn't know what I had and what I should be inneed, how I could kept so much things? I tryed to understand, loooking outside, talking with my friends and relatives when I realized that we were almost the same, buying, keeping without necessity.</p>\n<p>In my particular case I have been changing, I can't continuous to fill the world with so much stuff. what in the future it will be? We need to think about the people that come after us living with all this stuff. The Planet should be better for the news generations. Now, before going shopping I ask to myself am I inneed to buy something? This way of thinking brought to me more conciens that we need few things and it isn't necessary too much for being happy.</p>\n<h3>Rita</h3>\n<p>I don't have too many things at home. Actually, I use everything except a few wine cups and some spare sheets and blankets for guests. All my pots and pans are used almost every week.</p>\n<p>Some summer T-shirts are not so often used, it depends on my epilation frequency. (lol)</p>\n<p>Maybe I have too many cleansing products because I usually get them through the well-known offer: \"Buy 3 pay 2\".</p>\n<p>The fact that I have recently divorced and bought a new flat is very likely the reason why I don't have too much stuff at home.</p>\n<p>There is a feeling of scarcely here, but not material scarcely. It is a problem of loneliness and a lack of affection.</p>\n<h3>Hasan</h3>\n<p>Alright, first of all, I am too much grateful to you, because you give us such an opportunity. I have lived in Turkey until couple months ago. I absolutely can say that there are too much furniture, too much stuff in Turkish houses. Actually all of them reflect of a bit of our culture.</p>\n<p>I had a bit of mentioned headache, chronic fatigue until couple months ago. Now I’m living in Sweden. In here everything is more simple and pure. I gathered all of my unnecessary stuff and I threw all of them to garbage. What did I throw to garbage? First, I had too many video games, too much small clothes. And a few unnecessary goods.</p>\n<p>Sure, I like to shopping. It makes me happy, too much happy. But I'm pay attention to buy significant and necessary stuff.</p>\n<h3>Silvia, Italy</h3>\n<p>Some months ago I moved to a new house, so I had to pack all my stuff up. I had never realized before how many things I had: wardrobes, closets, the cellar and the attic full of old stuff or things I used maybe once or twice! It took ages to put everything in the boxes... Afterwards I spent few weeks on my granma's house. I brought with me only few indispensable objects and some clothes but I didn't need anything more. So I realized I had too much stuff in my new house and then I decided to throw, sell or give away lots of things. I felt lighter.</p>\n<h3>Cathrine, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>Well, what can I say about the stuff? It makes me depressed. I fill uncomfortable if there is too much stuff in my apartment.<br> <br/> I try to throw out all the unnecessary things as soon as I understand that I don't need them anymore. Also I have a rule. If I buy something new, I must get rid of something old. As well, I often do revision of closets, balconies and pantries to identify and throw out all the stuff. I like that picture on your site. Maybe it's too much, but there is some point in it.</br></p>\n<p>I think that the stuff can't make us happy. We need love, emotions, feelings, new experiences. Our life must be interesting; hardly a new vase or a carpet can replace the journey to the sea or play with children or chat with friends...</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos </h3>\n<p>Well, let me see... I'm in the attic and I am crazy. No that's other tail. Well, I turn my head around and I see two computers, old computers, toys, books, films, portraits. I could say too much stuff I would talk to my wife to select many of these things and throw them away, you know we have too much stuff but it isn't easy to say bye bye to all them. I don't know why but I have to take advice with her before move from one shelf to other. And if I want to rid an old magazine is impossible. I only get it if she doesn't know I'm going to do it. So if she is abroad and I am at home I can throw the parrot support away. I understand she wants to keep the dresses of when our daughter was a new born but we have the dresses of her cousins I don't why. There are too many things that hinder my sight and I would like to see books only books on the shelves.</p>\n<h3>Nuray</h3>\n<p>My room is very simply designed. Because I think when you raise your head, you shouldn't distract. When I read a book my only want is see the sky or trees not some kind of distracting stuff. So my opinion is having too much stuff is not a good for us. In the other hand, sometimes we feel so angry, lonely, depressed. And we want just buy something. Maybe it is a defence mechanism. We just want to redirect our feelings to something new. It is sometimes can be life saving.</p>\n<p>Ultimately all of the things are in our control :)</p>\n<h3>Tahnee, Brazil</h3>\n<p>When I was a child and lived with all my family, my two brothers and I shared a bedroom and we had so many things there, until my brother went to live alone. We felt happy to have more space to organize our furniture and buy more... then some few years after my sister went to live abroad and all of that things still in the bedroom. I thought about this and gave most of the clothes, accessories, toys for a charity institute, because a bit of these objects still making sense for me, because they bring me good memories from our childhood. So it is a good way to not have to much stuff: keep with you only something that make sense, other way, this things will make other people happy.</p>\n<h3>Alex, Russia</h3>\n<p>Every time I used t complain that there is not enough time to do sports and spend time with my family. Until, I realized that a lot of my personal time goes for the stuff I owned and buy. We all trying to get a good deal spending to much time searching for a sale, choosing the best item in the store, leaning all about new TV or a new model of phone. The worst come that we also spend a vast of our time for maintaining and keeping save the items which we owned. It a non stop. It's like a protein wheel they always create something new and you again have to get the best deal. It never stops.</p>\n<p>A fake life values drives our life, it keeps us busy day to day until we get old and understand that the beauty of life is in the experience. The life gives us a chance experience much more interesting things from traveling to love.</p>\n<p>I have changed my style of life, stop buying new trades and all the fashion items and keep only most important stuff for myself.</p>\n<p>I spend more time leaning, traveling and spending with people who I love.</p>\n<h3>Pamela, Argentina</h3>\n<p>I love travel, for the last five years I lived in four different cities, sharing apartment with others, but just renting a room. Because that, I decided to have the less stuff possible, It's easier to move and start again in a new home. I didn't need to have big stuff, neither furniture nor washing machine, in every apartment the rent of a room included this kind of things.</p>\n<p>In the last year I live as a couple and I have a formal job. Since then, I feel I started to accumulate more stuff, buying furniture and electronics. I believe that is the normal way when you start an adult life. However, my partner and I, both like to have new experiences, we still travel a lot, we prefer to use the money in this, instead buying things.</p>\n<h3>Adauto, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Buying a lot of unnecessary things can bring us a piece of happiness, but only for a little while. This habit is more common than we imagine, I think every people use to go shopping to buy some stuff which is really necessary,but along the way they find out goods with huge discounts and  the end of this story everybody knows, I mean more things which will hardly be used and in a little while will become a lot of garbage.</p>\n<h3>Patricio, Argentina</h3>\n<p>I live in an apartment and with minimum things that we bought with my girlfriend we are happy... Obviously you need to gain money to buy different things but the point is not getting crazy to obtain more and more...</p>\n<p>We like to travel and live many experiences in different places... We always are open to ask for a piece of advice in order to learn about the other...</p>\n<p>We hope to get to know many places in the future and get happiness in each of them!</p>\n<h3>Vasyl, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>My own home contains plenty of things. Moreover, there are too many things in my garage and there is too much stuff in my house in the country. And though every time I feel some irritation about something useless, however there is a bit of confidence and even hundreds of times there were no doubts that its time will come. For instance throughout past few years, building sauna in the country, I have been using too much so called garbage instead of buying all those construction materials. One more example: either travelling by car or having any trouble with electricity I take an old foam box instead of fridge and I hurry to assure you it was forgotten for many years before to receive its second chance. </p>\n<h3>Rodrigo, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Most of people enjoy shopping because it makes them feel better at that moment. I believe it's a temporary sensation and won't help us feel truly happy for a long time. Buying things is good, however I invite you to buy good \"memories\" or \"experiences\" as James Wallman suggested us in his book. Is it possible?</p>\n<p>But it's possible to build good memories and they will last forever. How? Traveling, meeting new things, cultures, people and so on. Leave your routine and live. There is a whole world outside waiting for you. It will be a journey of good experiences to remember during all your life and I'm sure every time you remember how good your experiences were, you'll feel better.</p>\n<h3>Cheniappan, India</h3>\n<p>I don't have too much stuff in my house because I don't have that much of money to buy. Even though I don't have money I felt happy but in recent times something (like cinema, TV, advertisements, etc.) push me to earn more money to buy expensive things. This type of articles makes me understand the reality and prevent me from doing something wrong. If I think like this I prefer ancient times where we had no money.</p>\n<h3>Richard, France</h3>\n<p>I think that having too much stuff is the sign of a discomfort. We don't need having many things to be happy. But in this consumer society, children have been often growing in the abundance. It's more difficult for them to find the happiness.</p>\n<h3>Diego, Italy</h3>\n<p>I'm an Italian student and I think that I haven't got too much stuff, but if I do a comparison with all the coetaneous of poor countries, I'm clearly 'stuffocate' (cit. James Wallman).</p>\n<p>With the Economic welfare and technology development of these last years, we could buy too many things that make our house much more comfortable and smart, but this isn't the happiness.</p>\n<p>Also shopping is the effect of a quick fashion development that make the people instantly very happy because it gets them away from the everyday work or life, but when you return at home this 'shopping wellness' sensation is already gone.</p>\n<h3>Irina, Russia</h3>\n<p>I really don't like having much stuff. There are only useful and necessary things in my home. All of them make my life easier and more comfortable. When I buy something new I give the old things to someone or to the charity organizations or if the thing is broken I throw it in the trash. Having too much stuff makes me a bit anxious.  It is much easier to breathe when there is a lot of free space around you. I think we don't need too many material things to be happy.</p>\n<h3>Beatriz</h3>\n<p>Yes, I have too much stuff in my closet and too many new suits for my job. Sometimes I can not find the blouse or the skirt of my uniform because all is in a mess, however  I think, I have some old clothes because they are too good to be out, and a lot of them are new so... I suppose, a bit of order it's needed here, only!</p>\n<h3>Emmanuel</h3>\n<p>This interview amazed me that there is a correlation between desire and health. At first, I thought \"having too much stuff\" was not my problem because I don't have enough money to buy things that I want and also I feel like I need to save money for my future. But, I do have desire to be rich and I will do whatever it takes to reach my goal. Having too much money might apply to correlation of desire and health. It's hard to picture myself that I would most likely to hurt myself mentally, if I pursue making more and more money.</p>\n<h3>Jurate, Lithuania</h3>\n<p>When I have someone visiting me at home I often get asked same questions: Haven't you got any chairs? Where's your table? My mom especially is disatisfied with me and points out now and again that neither a piece of nice new furniture nor a carpet would do any wrong to my place. But I still don't buy either of those. I like having few possessions because it helps me feel free. I prefer my place clean and simple to a plush one, I prefer space to things. In fact, I think I would feel bad with too many things. All there is in my room is an old wardrobe with a sofa that I got from my grandparents when they were refurnishing their home, a big gym mat and a laptop. To own less allows to see better what is going on beyond one's limited existence.</p>\n<h3>Emiliano, Italy</h3>\n<p>Too much stuff, right, true: in my case that mean dozens of books and some clothes wich will become fast older.<br/>But all our economy is based on production of things that we really donot need. If we stop to buy things, the shops will immediatly stop to sell thing, and of course the firm level would be bloked. Money in exchange of things, or better, at deeper level: all the things are producted for making money. With the 'financialization' we have tried to jump the step of the commodity making money from money... but it didn't work: money could be built from thin air, but this can create a disaster as we've seen, because they can desapperar in onvernight creating the worlwide panic.<br/>Every one must try to understand a bit of economy, because we must change our way of life. Mybe each and every one have to do a small private revolution.</p>\n<h3>Lisa, Netherlands</h3>\n<p>I have seriously too much stuff. I buy too many things I think. When I'm cleaning up my room, I have really no idea where I have to put all my stuff. I don't need so much stuff. I have a lot of make-up, clothes and shoes. Why? Because I like it. I like stuff. I like to go shopping with my father. I like to watch Vampire Diaries.</p>\n<h3>Nicholas, Netherlands</h3>\n<p>I think that people of now a days have too much stuff but we love buying new and more things. When we get new things we use it for a while but later on we don't use all the old stuff. I think that we must buy necessary things that we use years and years later. We don't always love too much stuff. It can be stressful. If you don't use stuff you can give it away to people who need it and still use it.</p>\n<h3>Hugo, Netherlands</h3>\n<p>I think I have a lot of stuff. I have too much clothing and too many books. But it's not making me sad because I love having stuff. Shopping sometimes makes me feel happy but sometimes it makes me feel sad. I think too much stuff is not good for people. Sometimes stuff makes people sad. And also buying stuff makes some people sad. If I buy things I feel happy. I don't know why but it gives me a good feeling.</p>\n<h3>Agata, Italy</h3>\n<p>When I lived in Italy, I earned a lot of money and with my family we bought a lot of things, a bigger house, a more powerful car, and many many stuff and clothes.<br/>When my daughter went away to study abroad my house looked empty and too big for me and my husband.<br/>I lost my job so I thought I could live with 100 of things and have new experiences.<br/>Now with my husband we have only 200 things and we are probably happier than before.<br/>All energies are to improve english language and have more experience.<br/>Some days I remember my previous life and a few tears go down but only for a few minutes.<br/>A bit of English humor make me happy again if I think that too much stress in having too many things.</p>\n<h3>Catherine, France</h3>\n<p>I can say that I have too much stuff at home and sometimes it makes me anxious, especially when I think about moving. Shopping new things is not really the problem but I am fifty seven and, in the long run, I've been keeping all my books , my children toys and a few little and less little presents.,<br/>Sometimes I give a bit of stuff, clothes and books and I throw out old newspapers, half broken kitchen equipment and I sort out a few papers. It's a little victory!<br/>But it's a fight with my husband who wants to keep everything!</p>\n<h3>Cinzia, Italy</h3>\n<p>I do agree with James Wallman. We have too many things we do not really need. However, in the past I used to buy stuff when I was stressed for my job or when I felt depressed.Today, I actually tend to buy too much food for my family even if it is not necessary because I'm afraid to have an empty fridge. Luckily, it is not a compulsory attitude for me but just something I'm aware of and I trying to control.<br/>I love reading a lot and if I could I will spend much money buying books but unfortunatly it is not always possible and therefore I borrow some from the local library.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I must say that money can't make you happy but it helps to have a better life.</p>\n<h3>Maury, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I agree with James Wallman when he says that having too much stuff in our lives can damage our health. When also he says that we buy a lot of things, but we never want to try on or we have used them before. I have seen too many people that want to be happy and they think that the happiness is in material things. But the same people forget that the happiness is in untouchable things like true experiences. I can exemplify: people can make a trip with their family or with their friends or even alone. Making a trip is a wonderful experience. In my opinion we have to buy useful things and we have to ask to ourselves before we buy them if, do we really need to buy all the these things?</p>\n<h3>Marie, Quebec</h3>\n<p>I completely agree with Mr Wallman. In French we have a saying : Owning nothing is Freedom. Believe me. I have experienced it, it’s true !<br/>At home in Quebec, I have too much stuff to take care. Some days, I can’t enjoy life as I should. I have to say a few « no » to many invitations.<br/>On other hand,I have a great opportunity to live in Hawaii for 6 months a year. Life is much lay back. I have a small studio and a small piece of luggage, that’s all. Life with friends is wonderful.<br/>All my day isn’t long enough to enjoy life away far from stuffocation. Too much stuff makes your life out of the essential pathway.</p>\n<h3>Alina, Romania</h3>\n<p>I had been living in communism when we hadn't found too much stuff as we are finding now. The stores' shelves had had very few products that quickly disappeared.</p>\n<p>But nowadays, Romanians are trying to overcome those bad memories and they have been buying almost everything, especially all the products that have some discount.</p>\n<p>Personally, I realised, I have had too much stuff on my wardrobe. Every time when I clean it, it is almost impossible not to find some out fashion clothes or clothes that sizes are inappropriate. Every time when I finds clothes that don't fit me, I give it to people who don't have.</p>\n<p>Life is about to gain more experiences than account money in our bank account. When we die, what we have is our life experience: how many books did you read, or how many places did you visit?</p>\n<p>We don't take any things with us, when we past away. Than why we don't focus much more on our life experiences not by having more things?</p>\n<h3>José Luis, Spain</h3>\n<p>I agree James Wallman. All of us have too many things. He is right because in develop countries we have lots of things at home: devices, furnitures, useless things, and meanly clothes. Our wardroves are plenty of clothes and many different stuff.</p>\n<p>I think that way is a little bit sad. A wrong way. I’m sure we can better enjoy life without the most of that stuff. We are really materialistic. We could share our wages with poor people and with fewer things, will would be happier.</p>\n<p>And finally, go shopping is not my favourite hobby.</p>\n<h3>Irene, Russia</h3>\n<p>Hello! As many women I like buying new stuff. Moreover I buy things I really don't need sometimes. Then all that clothes and items take too much place in my wardrobe but I use them seldom so it makes me feel depressed. That’s why I set a rule for myself. Every weekend I open my wardrobe and if I recognize that I haven’t been using some things for a long time I throw them out immediately. So I get enough space for something new or I just make some shelfs empty. I agree with James Wallman. Instead of buying new stuff we should spend more money on travelling for example. Because \"no matter how old your shoes if you walk in them in Paris\".</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>I think we've got too many things because we trick ourselves into believing that happiness is something we can buy through money, but such happiness lasts a very short period of time.</p>\n<p>As far as I'm concerned, money is important to the extent that it allows me to eat every day and have a place to sleep at night. I am really happy only when people make me feel esteemed, appreciated and helpful for all I do every day, but unfortunately it's not something we can always manage to get. Trying to buy too many things is also a way of gratifying ourselves every time we feel too much depressed.</p>\n<h3>Alessandra, Italy</h3>\n<p>I do agree with James Wallman, because I really have too many things in my home and above all in my wardrobe. Every morning I can’t decide which shirt or which trousers wear, however I feel very happy when I go shopping. It sounds incredible! I also have too much stuff around. It is because my friends give me some useless things for Christmas or for my birthday. At the end my partner and me have decided we give us a trip or a gig for Christmas or for birthday.</p>\n<h3>Erika</h3>\n<p>I used to live in a big apartment, I had too much stuff and not idea about that, I wasn't aware of how many things I had accumulated over the years, but I found out about it when I was about to move to a smaller apartment, I had too many boxes and much all my stuff couldn't fit in those boxes so I had to donate many things, especially stuff that I hardly used, which was a good thing, I could get rid of the things and also help people who need them.</p>\n<p>A few things remain in my new apartment, most of them are really necessary and it feels good to have a place with a bit of things.</p>\n<p>As the previous article argued, experiences counts more than materialism.<br/>There's a saying that says: Less is more and I couldn't agree more.</p>\n<h3>Mauro, Italy</h3>\n<p>Too much stuff im my house? Certainly! I've been collecting too many things during my travels all over the world. Some of them remind me unforgettable adventures, I'll keep them forever. Some people gave me a few of the others to remind their country, no way, I cant get rid of them! I think that all the things that are in my house have a reason to remain where I put them anyway. Probably the only useless thing standing now in my house is myself, so I'll go away to make another trip around the world.</p>\n<h3>Azizakif, Turkey</h3>\n<p>Materialism means my soul suffocates in things. Things designed by artists or manufacturer simulate all real stuff around us. It is impossible for me to relieve when l look at a fake of genuine. Therefore l would prefer a simple designed room or space.</p>\n<p>Simple designed space or house never has too much stuff. It provides me to think and move around freely. If my house or room had too many things, all my brain would be captured by things which are designed by other souls.</p>\n<p>Above all don't interpret that bed is enough for living. I am not a soulist. A few special items can be in my room. But correlation between me and a bit of stuff is crucial to stimulate my soul. For example my son's two small cars and his photograph make me feel better. I remember our experiences with him thanks to them. The experiences are vital at that point time and let off our soul from things.</p>\n<h3>Viridiana</h3>\n<p>I agree with the writer, stuffocation is bad for our health and nowadays it's a real problema, besides all the health problems mentioned in the texts it affects our energy, if we open our warddrobes and everything is in order and clean we feel good but if it's a mess, we have a lack of energy and immediately we start feeling bad. Peace also gives us health =)</p>\n<h3>Anazilda, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I do agree we have too much stuff and it is stealing our happiness. No one can fly with so much baggage.<br/>I try to live with simplicity. I only buy a piece of clothing if some other is not in good conditions any more, and I try to find someone who can reuse or recycle it. And if some friend give me one as a gift, I chose another do send do charity institutions.</p>\n<p>I do the same with furniture and other things. I have no car, no TV and just a simple tablet, not very expensive.</p>\n<p>But I cannot resist to buy books. I always buy much more books than I can read. I have no more space avaiable at home. I know I should donate my books to a public library, and borrow them when I have enough time to read, but I can't! Pehaps I need the help of the Annonymous Book Buyers :)</p>\n<h3>Trinh</h3>\n<p>A buffet is a typical example of the \"stuffocation\". You get in a fancy restaurant where a buffet is waiting for you. Too much food of the buffet makes you distracted and you usually could not manage to choose the right courses to make a good balance meal. Instead, you have a tendency to taste all of them. \"I do not know why I usually eat more at a buffet – it is not hunger, it is just greed\", said many people and most of them confess that they feel uncomfortable several days afterward, however delicious the food is.</p>\n<h3>Sonia, Poland</h3>\n<p>I love shopping and I've got quite much stuff especially in my wardrobe. Although it buying new things makes me happy sometimes I think that's shouldn't be the most important thing in our lives. Really sad event in my life had made that I have changed my point of view. Now I would like to travel, meet new people from all over the world and collect memories in my life - not just more and more things. Of course, money and some stuff help us live decently but I find that people who just work hard in order to buy new, better car, expensive clothes and the best stuff are not really happy. I want you all to remember that in our lives is just one and sure thing that no one can take away from us - our memories and experience.</p>\n<h3>Kate</h3>\n<p>Yes, I have too much stuff, especially in my wardrobe. When I make an order with my clothes a few of them I leave because I think that I put it on one more time, but in just a bit of them it’s true. Having a lot of cloths doesn't make me happy. Like each women often I have a problem what I wear. I look for a cloth in my wardrobe and I don't found anything despite too many things. But I love buy a lot of things to my house it's the best think to get the better humor.</p>\n<h3>Angel, Spain</h3>\n<p>A lot of time ago, when I began to work and I earned my firsts salaries, I remember that I wanted to buy a lot of things. In few months I had my home full of stuff. This was for a while. After a few years, I realized that too much stuff in your life, like the earlier text claim, makes the life more complex.<br/>Now, I try having few things. I say that everything you need must fit into a rucksack. The more important things in the life don't take up physical space, but space in your mind and in your hearth.</p>\n<h3>Pia, Germany</h3>\n<p>I really think I've too much stuff. I've collected many things over years and now I'm not able to give them away. It's not because of memories, it's because I don't know where to start. All these things overwhelm me. I think it would be a good feeling to donate most of the things and to reduce my property. In my opinion we'll be satisfied, if we spent more time with our families and friends, instead of consuming.</p>\n<h3>Khalid, Yemen</h3>\n<p>I love easy life. Having a lot of things could make me upset, so before I decide getting anything I think about its importance for my life. I think all essential needs are fewer than luxuries. When people have too many things, they lose how enjoy them. I have some clothes, so I can choose easily, I have not too much furniture in my house, because I feel happy when live in wide place, even when I travel I take a few things.</p>\n<h3>Claudia, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I'm a Brazilian student. I don't have a lot of things, and I try to have less and less things, 'cause I do agree with James Wallman; people have too much stuff and try to find hapiness on it, and not in the experiences we have in our lives.<br/>Putting hapiness on stuff could make people ill, because in te end they realize that money and stuff ins't everthing, and that's the illness.<br/>We have to learn to live with a few things, stop to go shopping just because we're upset with something, or 'cause we're stressed out. Hapiness is inside of you and me, our mission is findind it in each other.</p>\n<h3>Dan Sun, China</h3>\n<p><strong>All </strong>female friends of mind enjoy shopping. <strong>Some</strong> of them keep saying that there is always one dress missing in their closets, even though they have <strong>too many</strong> clothes hanging in there, it’s still difficult to pick up one to put on. From my point of view, shopping is a good way to help me relax as well as the way to spend <strong>a bit of</strong> time with my friend every week while I am doing that.  We try on new clothes and give advice to each other, sometimes we don’t buy it if it costs <strong>too much</strong>. I think everything should be in a certain balance, going shopping <strong>a few</strong> times every month is reasonable, just don’t overdo it.</p>\n<h3>Nuria, Barcelona</h3>\n<p>Yes, I have too much stuff in my house. I like buying a lot of thinks by internet because the price is good. But now I'm trying to buy only some things that I need.</p>\n<p>Once or twice a year I organize my wardrobe, my library and I give my old things to someone or a charity organization. When I finish that I feel better.</p>\n<h3>Pavlo, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I have lots of stuff at my home but it doesn’t make me uncomfortable. I believe that if you keep all your things in right places it will never disturb you. In addition to this you will always have access to everything you need.</p>\n<p>However you have to spend a bit of your free time to clean up. Of course you won’t like it but it’s better than spending much more time to choose what to keep and what to throw out.</p>\n<p>All in all I think that the best way to deal with useless stuff is to think twice before buying something new to your house.</p>\n<h3>Tania, Italy</h3>\n<p>I have too much stuff in my home! I'd like to live in empty spaces but the reality is a little bit different: all my rooms are full of things and some objects I have are really unuseful!  I have too many shoes, too much baggage, many books, and even too much forniture. I'm happy to have many books but sometimes I think I've lost a lot of time and too much money to buy all this stuff I don't really need. And so I would like to get free from this stuff in few minutes, using a little bit of magic.</p>\n<h3>Erdem Erbey, Turkey</h3>\n<p>I think this subject is closing releated with minimalism. Minimalism is a movement of idea that influence various field like art or music claim be simplicity. for consumption I read an interetsting minimalist idea that suggest have limited good or things. For example you should to decide haw many shirts would you keep in your gardrobe. it depends on you, it could be 5 or 10. And when you determine the number of shirts that you wear in a year you should follow this rule. so if you want to or intend to buy a new shirts you can't only consider having enough money you olso think about which shirts would you throw out in your gardorbe instead of this? This solution help me very much and when we take together its with this novel we could say that limit our consumption is important for our happiness not only economic conditions.</p>\n<h3>Irene, Spain</h3>\n<p>I think I’m actually stuffocating. Every day I realize more and more the problem that is causing me owing too much stuff and particularly all the things I have at home. It makes me angry, nervous and upset each time I’m trying to decide what to wear and I have so many T-shirt that I haven’t   even wear yet, or when looking in my drawer for something I need urgently but I can’t find it because it’s full up with other useless objects or rooting around through all the bottles of spices we have, just to decide which one I need. For that reason I’m gonna try to concentrate in things that really make me happy, like traveling, learning new facts and living exiting experiences instead of worrying about the things I have and the ones I don’t have already in my closet.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Salvador López, Panamá</h3>\n<p>So, I don´t like to have too much stuff in my apartment, i love open spaces, that´s makes me feel free and confortable.  Some times I get a few antiques objetcs to ornament my living room, some things like cameras, music instruments and old toys.  In Panama, our weather is tropical and humidity, that´s just because, I need to have free space to breath phisycall and mentality.</p>\n<h3>Svetlana</h3>\n<p>I like comfort, and I hate lacking of something I need at the moment. I am not a rich person and I don't have luxury things. But I love my big bed and my lovely deep armchair that I like sitting in the evening and watching an expensive TV with high-quality picture. Why should these all things make me less happy? Vice versa, I am glad that my wardrobe is ready for every event in my life: work, a meeting, a date, a party, a barbeque with friends. Some time I notice that I have too much clothes, then I look over my dresses and give some of them to over people.</p>\n<h3>Ammår</h3>\n<p>Before a few months ago , I lived in suffocation hell since i had started my study in college of architecture , Loads of carton foam paper ... etc , on bed on my office  down top bottom .... anywhere , cleaning the room be very deficullt work ,, finally my room was neglected because i dont have a time to clean it ... nowdays im in holiday month im work every day to room still clean and fresh ..  </p>\n<p>im hopeful :) </p>\n<h3>Monize</h3>\n<p>Nowadays people live in an individualistic way. The capitalist world dominates the global culture. Every day, people are bombarded with many advertisements about products that claim are essential to living well. This ultimately results in an exaggerated increase in consumerism and accumulation of things, which often become unnecessary and futile. But the essential question is: Does money buy happiness? The truth is that money helps to bring comfort, whose sense may seem happiness, but it is not. It is not uncommon to realize a sense of loneliness in the midst of so many people, those who have a large amount of money. The sincere and unpretentious friendship does not arise from greed and falsehood. Each sincere friendship brings happiness, fullness and satisfaction. Likewise is in relation to the care of close relationships, every smile of those who like, every thank you for a good deed. Anyway, money helps to survive in a globalized world, but do not buy the full happiness, just adds to the feeling of all illusion to think that one is happy.</p>\n<h3>Javier, Bilbao</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve got a problem because of all the stuff I’ve got at home. I live in a small flat where there is not enough place for so many things. Not all of them are useful, a few of them are needed things like my motorbike clothing but on the other hand I retain too many useless things like old student´s books from my childhood or some old-fashioned furniture that I will never use again.</p>\n<p>So my conclusion is clear, It´s better to make do with not too many things rather than owning too much staff and no place to keep it.</p>\n<h3>Viviana, Italy</h3>\n<p>That's true. We live overwhelmed by too much stuff, and I don't really know how much useful they are. I realize this thing everytime I prepare my camping backpack before to leave for 10 days into the woods. I can put in there just a few things, but they are enough for those days. There's no need to overdo in our lives. The objects do not make us happy, do not complete us and do not change our lives. We can learn all these things just living day by day, meeting people and making experiences, just like James Wallman says.</p>\n<h3>Ibrahim</h3>\n<p>What I think about stuff?</p>\n<p>    In my opinion that most people buy alot of things which is not mandatory in their life. They spend too much money to fill their homes in unuseful furniture.</p>\n<p>    In my country people always buy what they don't use, unfortunately this is reflect to our culture.</p>\n<p>    I think neither scarcity nor abundance are good, people should buy what they need necessary, moreover they should kick off old stuff.</p>\n<p>    For me I like shopping, so actually I have too much thing I have to throw it out.</p>\n<h3>Antonio, Spain</h3>\n<p>I don’t think I have too much stuff in my home.</p>\n<p>Right now, I’ve been living with my girlfriend. We are tidy and we haven't got too many objects in our house.</p>\n<p>In my case, I have too much clothes, even more than my partner. But, twice a year, I donate the clothes that I didn't use. Nowadays, I also buy new clothes, normally in winter and summer sales discounts.</p>\n<p>I think is important to be tidy and to know how many things you need in your life to be happy. You will not be happier by having too much stuff.</p>\n<h3>Akin</h3>\n<p>Yes I have too much stuff.Actually we have,because of I've maried and I've got a child who is 15 years old girl.I think in this 20th centry,every women and too mant men are addicted shopping. This kind of people ,without thinking wheter they need to have things,just do shopping to be happy.İndeed it's like to use alcohol or drugs and to smoke.They just want to buy something,it's not important what it is that they need it.So,they come back their home and put all of things which bought to wordrobe or cupboard or somewhere sort of that,next day they are unhappy again İf they won't go shopping.</p>\n<p>                My wife is a prototipe of this kind of person,I think mt daughter will be in the close future.I don't able to do to change all of this.</p>\n<h3>Ília</h3>\n<p>There was a time I spent a lot of money and time buying too much stuff especially when I had a new home.<br/> But quickly I realized that as more full of stuff I had at home and wardrobe more dificult cleaning and organizing was.<br/> So I started doing the opposite, trying to keep just the necessary stuff. <br/> Now I always do that balance keeping the most necessary and buying less that it is possible and tranfering money spent in thing to experiences with family and friends or traveling looking for more fullfilment.<br/> But even with experinces we have to take it with balance and intelligence not running to live everything as to do with stuff.<br/> On that case we can create a similar word to stuffocating like \"expfocating\".</p>\n<h3>Pawan, Nepal</h3>\n<p>Off and on, I go shopping - haggle at times - and buy some superfluous stuff. Often I feel my predilection for gadgets has cost me much but I do not resent it.<br/> <br/> I rather understand 'Stuffocation' is the conflict between desire and need, where desire surmounts the need. So, in my opinion, people in trying to keep up cachet in society, buy too many ostentatious stuff that has very little usage - giving room for 'sttuffocation'.</p>\n<h3>Francesco</h3>\n<p>James Wallman ideas are very interesting but he only shows a partial view.<br/> As in other situation the truth lies in the center. too much stuff smothers probably and an empty house is a very desolation set-up. In my opinion the stuff value  changes in order to our link with things. Last Sunday I have met an homeless with a shopping cart extremely full of things and in the afternoon I have visited some rich friends; they lived in a minimal style house with  a bit of stuff on the carpet and only with some furniture. Who has more things? Who is more fortunate? I don’t Know.</p>\n<h3>Guille</h3>\n<p>Sometimes we lose something that we had been keeping because it was very important and we realize that it wasn’t important at all; we aren’t sad without it. I really have liked the final conclusion, we have to try to change our finding of happiness in having more things to live more a better experiences. Of course is really difficult in today’s world, full of marketing campaigns which associated his products with happiness, respect and admiration. We will have to try our best, it will be a hard fight against the materialism.</p>\n<h3>Arielle</h3>\n<p>I am not well-paid but my work stresses me so much. I can’t even plan to do something else in a day without something at work coming on to avoid it. I have no time for me, all goes to my work. I have no time to see what happens in everyday life like buying new clothes or just chilling out with friends.</p>\n<p>In fact, my job manages my time schedule and the matter is not that I do not have enough money to really live; the matter is that I have not enough time to enjoy life. I can’t bear this situation but changing it means seeking a new job with different conditions. Is it a solution?</p>\n<p>Actually, I think I just have to master my life not letting my job does it in my place in order to have some free time and days-off to appreciate moments in life.</p>\n<h3>Alfonso, Spain</h3>\n<p>Reading Wallman's article makes me think of this subject. All of us are living in a very material world, we are always buying stuff we do not need. I know that sometimes, when we are sad, we need to buy something that makes us happy for a while, but we should buy only what we need.</p>\n<p>      We live in a technological world, everyday there is a new mobile phone, more sophisticated than the previous one, or a new tablet, a new car, a new television, a new bike, and when we see them, the first thing we think is: \"I want it!\"</p>\n<p>      But we have to reflect on buying only necessary stuff. When we want to get something, that thing is fantastic, marvellous, but when we get it, it is not as beautiful as before, because desire is too much strong.</p>\n<p>      I agree with Wallman, experiences are very good to be happy, stay with people you love, read a book, go to a concert, travel, etc.</p>\n<p>     Stuff makes us slaves.</p>\n<h3>Vitaliy Debre, Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>in general, I do not have a lot of stuff, because my apartment is not quite big enough and there is no place for storing too many things. Nevertheless, I still have had a problem with things which I do not use but I keep it at home and do not throw it away. I have such a kind of attachment and feel some old connection with them. </p>\n<p>Anyway, time to time I do a big revision of things and try to get rid of stuff as much as I can which I do not use a long time or I do not like.</p>\n<p>Also, I try to keep order in the rooms and hide some stuff to the cupboard and boxes of different size. I believe if it is the order in the space around me it will be the order in my head :).</p>\n<p>I like to live in a clean place, but not as on your picture. I think it is a little bit too clean for me, as in the hospital. :)</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session.

Today we’re talking about short spoken forms. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's words like <strong>gonna</strong>, <strong>wanna</strong> and <strong>gotta</strong> that we use a lot in spoken English. Let’s start by listening to Jason and Yuki talking about their plans for the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And here’s a question: Who’s Yuki meeting on Saturday night? Have a listen.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong><strong>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Yuki<br/></span></strong><span>I<strong> dunno. </strong>I’m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Jason<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Yuki<br/></span></strong><span>No, thanks. I’ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Jason<br/></span></strong><span>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well that was Jason and Yuki. We asked you: Who’s Yuki meeting on Saturday night?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine    <br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: she’s probably going to meet Lucy.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>That’s right. But instead of saying <strong>going to</strong>, Yuki said <strong>gonna</strong>. <strong>She’s probably gonna meet Lucy</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and that’s what we’re looking at in this programme. English speakers often say the words<strong> going to </strong>very fast – and it sounds like<strong> gonna. </strong>They usually do this in informal situations when they’re talking to friends.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So does that mean that you shouldn’t say <strong>gonna</strong> when you need to speak carefully and politely, like in a job interview?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, not necessarily. If <strong>gonna</strong> comes out naturally, it’s probably ok. But a job interview is formal, so it’s probably a bit more polite to say <strong>going to</strong>. And you don’t usually use <strong>gonna</strong> in writing, unless you’re actually writing down a dialogue.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In fact some people never use it, even informally. Although it’s probably more common in American English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And one other thing about <strong>gonna</strong> is that we only use it to replace <strong>going to</strong> when it’s followed by a verb.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. If you say: <strong>I’m going to Paris</strong>, you can’t use <strong>gonna</strong> to say: I’m <strong>gonna</strong> Paris. You’d have to add a verb, like this, and say: <strong>I’m gonna go to Paris</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>I'm gonna go to Paris</strong>. Let’s have another clip with some more short spoken forms.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1      <br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jason<br/>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Yuki<br/></strong></span><span>I<strong> dunno. </strong>I’m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So Jason said <strong>whatcha</strong>. <strong>Whatcha</strong>. That’s a short form of <strong>what are you</strong>. Or sometimes <strong>what do you</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And Yuki said <strong>I dunno</strong>. <strong>I dunno</strong>. That’s a short spoken form of <strong>I don’t know</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have another clip. See if you can spot any more.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong></span><span>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Yuki<br/></strong></span><span>No, thanks. I’ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Did you get them? We heard <strong>wanna</strong>. That’s a short form of <strong>want to</strong>. <strong>Do you wanna come to the cinema in the afternoon</strong>? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And there was also <strong>gotta</strong>. <strong>Gotta</strong>.<strong> I’ve</strong><strong> gotta finish an English essay</strong>. Here, <strong>gotta</strong> is short for <strong>got to</strong>. But <strong>gotta</strong> can also be short for the possessive <strong>got a</strong>, like in <strong>I’ve gotta new mobile</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now for the last clip.</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong></span><span>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Can you guess what <strong>lemme</strong> is short for? It’s <strong>let me. Let me know if you change your mind.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And there are others like <strong>hafta</strong>,<strong> hafta</strong>, for <strong>have to</strong> or <strong>gimme</strong>, that's <strong>gimme</strong>, for <strong>give me</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now what about <strong>kinda</strong>, <strong>kinda</strong>, for <strong>kind of</strong>? Like <strong>She’s kinda nice</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we’re talking about spoken short forms. So Catherine, <strong>whatcha gonna</strong> do in the quiz?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's go. Quiz question number one: what’s a more informal way to say <strong>I’ve got to phone the bank</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It’s <strong>I’ve gotta phone the bank</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Good. And number two: you want to know what your friend is doing tonight. How can you ask them, using a spoken short form?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>You could say: <strong>whatcha doing tonight</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And number three: you think it’s going to rain. Tell your friend using a spoken short form.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>You could say:<strong> I think it’s gonna rain</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. Now before we go, here’s a vocabulary tip. Try to watch TV, movies and video clips regularly in English. Listen out for short spoken forms and practise repeating them. It will help you to understand better when you listen and sound more natural when you speak.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>. We’ve <strong>gotta</strong> go now, but do join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><strong>Spoken short forms</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span><strong>Gonna, wanna, dunno, whatcha</strong>... are these really English words? Who uses them and why? Finn and Catherine give you an introduction to short spoken forms in 6 Minute Vocabulary.</span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-4/downloads\">Unit 4 Downloads </a>page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9xz/episodes/downloads\">podcast version</a>.</p>\n<h3>Vocabulary points to take away</h3>\n<p>Spoken short forms are ways of saying phrases quickly in informal situations. Some common examples are:</p>\n<p><strong>gonna - going to</strong><br/><em>I'm gonna watch a DVD.</em></p>\n<p><strong>wanna - want to<br/></strong><em>Do you wanna watch too?</em></p>\n<p><strong>whatcha - what are you</strong><br/><em>Whatcha doing?</em></p>\n<p><strong>dunno - don’t know</strong><br/><em>I dunno.</em></p>\n<p><strong>gotta - got to (or got a)</strong><br/><em>I've gotta go now.</em></p>\n<p><strong>hafta - have to</strong><br/><em>Do you hafta go already?</em></p>\n<p><strong>gimme - give me</strong><br/><em>Gimme a call tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p><strong>lemme - let me</strong><br/><em>Lemme know what you think.</em></p>\n<p><strong>kinda - kind of</strong><br/><em>She's kinda nice.</em></p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, there are lots of spoken short forms in informal English. In the next activity, you listen to a conversation and find all the short forms. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>I gotta practise these short forms...</h3>\n<p>In 6 Minute English we heard a lot of different spoken short forms. They're quite common in informal English, but you very rarely see them written down.</p>\n<p>So, how well do you know them? We're going to play you a short conversation between Finn and Rob with lots of short forms, and you have to find them.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>The conversation is six lines long. Listen to it at least twice, and write down any short forms you hear. Then, try to answer the questions in the quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Got that? Now for the quiz. Play the audio again if you need to.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done! Next there's a chance for you to practise the pronunciation of all these forms. Practice makes perfect, as they say. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Repeat after me...</h3>\n<p>This session is all about spoken English, so in this activity you'll have the chance to practise saying these short forms with Finn.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In this listening and speaking activity, all you have to do is listen to Finn and repeat when he tells you to. There are gaps in the audio for you to speak in. Listen as many times as you like. There is a transcript, but it's best just to listen as carefully as possible - don't worry too much about how the words are spelt.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session. We hope you've enjoyed practising these short forms. In Session 2 we're looking at this unit's grammar - multi-word verbs. Don't <strong>let us down -</strong> join us and <strong>keep up with</strong> this useful area of grammar!</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar. I'm Finn…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we'll explain what they are and how you use them...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We'll have lots of examples and of course we'll finish with a quiz.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But first, let's listen to Mary. She's a lifestyle coach and she has some advice for us about friends and friendship.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And listen out for the answer to this question: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br/></strong>How often do you and your friends <strong>get together</strong>? In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let our </strong>friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>. Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by </strong>us when we need support. So while it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media, psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So that was Mary. And we asked: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: They say it's important for us and our friends to <strong>meet up</strong>. And I think they mean face to face. What do you think, Finn?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>They do. Face-to-face meeting up is the best thing, they say. And there's our first phrasal verb - <strong>meet up</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, meet up. Now, a phrasal verb is a two-word verb made of a verb plus a little word like <strong>in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, or<strong> up</strong>. We usually think of<strong> in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, and<strong> up</strong> as prepositions, but in phrasal verbs they behave more like adverbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>They do. In the phrasal verb <strong>meet up</strong>, the adverb <strong>up</strong> modifies the meaning of the verb <strong>meet</strong>. <strong>Meet</strong> and <strong>meet up</strong> are very similar in meaning. But the adverb sometimes does more than that. Listen to this clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Mary<br/></span></strong><span>...psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Right, we heard the phrasal verb <strong>point out</strong> there, but it doesn't mean the same as the verb <strong>point</strong>. <strong>Point out</strong> means to say something interesting, or unusual or useful. And the adverb changes the meaning significantly. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It does. Now listen out for more phrasal verbs in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mary   <br/></strong>In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let </strong>our friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now if we <strong>let</strong> our friends <strong>down</strong>, it means that we don't help or support them. And when we <strong>put off</strong> arrangements, we cancel or delay them. And if we <strong>ring</strong> people <strong>up</strong>, we phone them.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And those are interesting phrasal verbs because when they have an object, we can put the object either between the verb and the adverb, or we can put it after the adverb.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Like this: we can <strong>let our friends down</strong> or we can <strong>let down our friends</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>You wouldn't let your friends down.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I'd never let my friends down, Catherine. Or my colleagues.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we can <strong>put off arrangements</strong> or <strong>put arrangements off</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We can. But be careful. If the object is a pronoun, you have to put it in the middle. For example, you have to say <strong>ring them up</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. Don't say <strong>ring up them</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>No, don't say that. Now, one more clip. Can you spot any more phrasal verbs?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br/></strong></span><span>Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by us</strong> when we need support.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we just heard<strong> stand by us.</strong> And you are probably wondering why the pronoun is at the end of the verb because we just said that you can't put pronouns at the end. But <strong>stand by</strong> is a slightly different type of verb, because <strong>by</strong> isn't an adverb. It's a preposition.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. In some two-word verbs, the second word such as <strong>by</strong>,<strong> with</strong>,<strong> into</strong>, or<strong> on </strong>behaves like a preposition, not an adverb. And in these verbs, the object or object pronoun always comes after the preposition.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK. So Mary said that it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media. And <strong>keep up with</strong> means <strong>keep in contact with</strong>, and it's a phrasal verb made of three parts: a verb: <strong>keep</strong>, plus an adverb: <strong>up</strong>, plus a preposition: <strong>with</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And with phrasal verbs with three parts, the object always comes at the end. We <strong>keep up with people</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it's time for a quiz! Number one. Is this sentence correct or wrong? She took her coat off, hung it up and sat down. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number two: correct or wrong? We keep with each other up by phone and email.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that one is wrong...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I know.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...sounds horrible! The correct sentence is: We keep up with each other by phone and email. So, number three: I turned down the job because it was too far away. Now the question is: can you also say a) I turned down it. Or b) I turned it down?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>Well, this time you can say b) I turned it down. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>You can.

And occasionally there's even a third word, as in <strong>break up with</strong>…</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>In this session we'll introduce you to the wonderful world of <strong>multi-word verbs</strong>, often known as <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>. There are lots of them in English and their meanings can be quite confusing - as</span></span><span><span> you might know, when we add a second word to the main verb it usually changes the meaning. Let's take a look at how this works with the main verb <strong>break</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read this short story about a man who decided to rob a bank. How many examples of multi-word verbs with <strong>break </strong>are there? And what do they mean?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Mark the monkey robber</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Mark broke in at midnight. He stuffed as much cash as he could into a sack and ran back to his car. But just as he was driving away, the car broke down.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Mark was caught and went to jail. But every day he thought of new ways to break out. Finally he escaped, dressed as a gorilla. But when he got home, his girlfriend broke up with him. She said she didn't want a man who robbed banks and dressed as a monkey.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do </span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>A sad ending for Mark. But did you count all four multi-word verbs? They were: to <strong>break in</strong>, to <strong>break down</strong>, to <strong>break out</strong> and to <strong>break up (with)</strong>. You might know some of them already. But just to make sure, let's do a test about their meanings. Can you work them out from the story?</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Grammar</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>So, as you've seen, these four multi-word verbs have different meanings. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>They are made of the main verb, <strong>break</strong>, and an adverb, like <strong>in</strong>, <strong>out</strong>, <strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong>. You might recognise <strong>in</strong>, <strong>up</strong>, <strong>out</strong> and <strong>down</strong> as prepositions, but here they behave more like adverbs. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>And some of them can be followed by a preposition, like <strong>with</strong>. Normally we say you <strong>break up 'with'</strong> someone.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Multiple meanings</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>And these aren't the only multi-word verbs with break. If you <strong>break away</strong> from a group, for example, you leave it. And how about to <strong>b</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>reak off</strong>? Well, it has three meanings:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>1) to separate something from something else<br/>He <strong>broke off</strong> a bit of naan bread to eat.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>2) to end a relationship<br/>They <strong>broke off</strong> their engagement after only a week.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>3) to suddenly stop speaking<br/>Magnus <strong>broke off</strong> in the middle of his sentence when his girlfriend walked in.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So as you can see, it's a huge topic. In fact, there are whole books just about phrasal verbs. For more help visit our grammar reference, which has more information about the form, meaning and use of multi-word verbs. </span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Next</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>So how do we begin to make sense of the world of multi-word verbs? One way is to learn them in groups by topic. That's what we'll do next, with the topic of travel. See you there!</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Set off, touch down, check in...</h3>\n<p>So far we've looked at a group of multi-word verbs that come from <strong>break</strong>. But with so many out there, what's the best way to learn them? Well, one way is to learn words in groups by topic. So, now we're going to do an exercise to practise multi-word verbs related to the theme of travel.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First, take a moment to learn these phrasal verbs related to travel.

Now, imagine that your boyfriend or girlfriend <strong>dumped</strong> you just before you were planning to go away. What would you do? Well, this actually happened to John Whitbread from Leicestershire in the UK. He was left with an extra ticket to the Dominican Republic after he <strong>split up</strong> with his girlfriend six weeks before they were going to get married.</p>\n<p>John Whitbread originally planned to get married on Valentine's Day but this changed when the couple<strong> </strong>ended their relationship over Christmas. Mr Whitbread had worked non-stop to pay for the cost of the trip, which came to just under £2,000. He went to the travel agent to see if he could <strong>get back</strong> any of the money that he had spent on the trip, but they only offered him a refund for half of the money.</p>\n<p>So, John was left with a <strong>spare</strong> ticket for a trip to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<h3>So, what's the problem?</h3>\n<p>Did you get it? John Whitbread has too many tickets to go to the Caribbean - he has an extra ticket because his girlfriend isn't coming.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Time to check your vocabulary knowledge!

He posted it on an auction website and was <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by the response. Soon he had 65 <strong>bidders</strong> competing for the chance to buy a ticket to a Caribbean paradise. But things did not go completely according to plan.</p>\n<p>Things were <strong>looking up</strong> when the auction closed and the highest bid of £8,000 had been made. However, it wasn't to be and the bidder failed to pay for the ticket. Mr Whitbread, who had been <strong>jilted </strong>by his fiancée before his wedding, was rejected again. And it got worse: he was disappointed yet again when the second-highest bidder for the honeymoon trip also <strong>pulled out</strong>.</p>\n<p>What could he do? Mr Whitbread decided to sell £10 raffle tickets for the chance to win the place on the trip and managed to raise £1,420 for the charity Balls to Cancer. The eventual winner was Kelly Wood from Suffolk. The pair didn't <strong>meet up</strong> in person until the actual day they <strong>went away</strong>. Mr Whitbread said that not meeting before the trip would make it more fun.</p>\n<h3>Did you work out what John did next?</h3>\n<p>He auctioned - or put up for sale - his extra ticket.

I only recently split up with my girlfriend.\"</p>\n<p>But he added: \"I've made a friend out of it and it's brilliant. It could have easily gone the other way.

In this case, we're going to learn how to make a complaint when you're staying in a hotel. A polite complaint, of course! </br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So, picture the scene – you're on holiday, you're in your hotel room, but there are a few problems: the kettle is not working, there aren't any slippers, and there's no hot water. What to do? Are there any strategies, or special words and phrases that you could use? Well, yes, there are.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So, how about this: we'll do a small roleplay – I'll be the receptionist… (clears throat) the receptionist, there we are – and I'll wait for the guests to call me with their problems. Listen out for how they complain – do they say the problem straight away? Ooh, there's the phone now.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Hello, reception?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Hello reception. It's Mr Carter here. I checked into the room on the 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> floor just a few minutes ago actually. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Okay.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Yeah, well, everything's fine, it's a lovely room, but the problem, you know, is, I was really desperate for a drink and the mini-bar's empty.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>It's me again. That sounded a bit like Rob. Anyway, his mini-bar was empty, that was his problem. But he didn't tell me the problem straight away. First, he gave the background, he set the scene, he told me a little story, about how he checked into the room a few minutes ago, and everything was fine, he even gave a compliment – that it was a lovely room… And he also gave a reason for needing the minibar – that he was desperate for a drink. Listen again:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>It's Mr Carter here. I checked into the room on the 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> floor just a few minutes ago actually. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Okay.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Yeah, well, everything's fine, it's a lovely room, but the problem is, I was really desperate for a drink and the mini-bar's empty.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>So, this is quite common – people don't go straight into the problem, first they tell the story – how they came to the problem. Now, sadly, the lack of cold drinks isn't Rob's only problem here. Let's listen to a bit more of the conversation. What's wrong this time?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Well there is one more thing.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Right.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Because I couldn't get a drink out of the mini-bar I was trying to make a cup of tea, but the kettle isn’t working.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Ah. Right.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I filled it up with water and plugged it in, and I've switched the switch on, but it doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working, really.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Yes. This time the kettle's not working. Again he told a story – about why he wanted to use the kettle – to make a cup of tea. And then he said how he tried and failed to use it successfully. But there's more – listen to this phrase. What does he say instead of 'it's not working'?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>It doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working, really.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>It doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working. Now, that's a softer way of saying 'it's not working'. In fact, he doesn't directly say that it's not working at all – when he says it doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working, it's as if there's even a possibility that it's Rob's fault. So this is a very soft way of making a complaint. </span></span><span><span>You'll hear <strong>seem to</strong> quite often. It's often used with a negative auxiliary like <strong>can't</strong> or <strong>doesn't.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>The hot water <strong>doesn't seem to</strong> be working.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>I <strong>can't seem to</strong> find any slippers in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>But you can also use it in a positive sentence with no auxiliary.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>There <strong>seems to</strong> be a problem with the hot water.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>There <strong>seem to</strong> be no slippers in here.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>And there's another phrase which is very similar: <strong>appear to</strong>. Again with a negative auxiliary:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>There <strong>don't</strong> <strong>appear to</strong> be any slippers in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>The hot water <strong>doesn't</strong> <strong>appear to</strong> be working.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>And in a positive sentence with no auxiliary:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>There <strong>appears to</strong> be a problem with the hot water.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>There <strong>appear to</strong> be no slippers in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>So – those are my two tips: tell a bit of a story, give a bit of background before going into your problem or complaint. And use phrases like <strong>seem to</strong> or<strong> appear to</strong> to soften your language. </span></span><span><span>But remember – you do need to make your point clear, even though you're being polite.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Well that's it from me, but I'll leave you with one more conversation to listen to. <strong>Catherine</strong> seems to be having a problem in her room - and what is it with slippers in this hotel?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Hello. Yes, reception. Can I help you?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Hello. Yes, it's <strong>Catherine</strong> here. I'm in room 207.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Hi there.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>I wonder if you can help me? I've got a couple of problems.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Okay.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>I've been running a bath and the water's cold. I can't get any hot water.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Oh, I'm very sorry about that. I'll send someone to have a look at that right away. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Thank you, if you would, that would be great.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Yes, of course.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Thank you very much. And something else I've spotted, actually, is, in the room there <strong>don't seem to</strong> be any slippers.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <br/><span><span>No slippers, huh?</span></span></p>\n<p><span></span><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>No, I'm afraid not, no. There's normally a pair of little paper slippers aren’t there? And I just can't find them anywhere…</p> </div>",

Things don't always go our way, so being able to make a complaint is a useful skill in any language. But how do you do it effectively and politely in English?</p>\n<p>The British are famed for their politeness, so let's listen to Finn and the Learning English team as they do some roleplays in a fictional hotel. Which phrases do native English speakers use when they are complaining?</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to the programme. What is missing from both Rob and Catherine's hotel rooms?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download the programme and transcript from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-4/downloads\">Unit 4 Downloads</a> page.</p>\n<h3>Language tips</h3>\n<p>So what was missing from Rob and Catherine's rooms? Slippers! Essential in any good hotel room.</p>\n<p>Now let's remind ourselves of the language tips and tricks that can help us to make better complaints:</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Tell a story</strong></h3>\n<p>Don't go straight into your problem or complaint. Give a little background first, so the listener understands your situation better. Don't make it too long though! Here are two good examples from the programme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I checked into the room on the 4th floor just a few minutes ago. It's a lovely room, but the problem is that I was really desperate for a drink and the mini-bar's empty.</li>\n<li>Because I couldn't get a drink out of the mini-bar I was trying to make a cup of tea, but<br/>the kettle isn’t working.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2) Use softening language</h3>\n<p>Instead of directly saying that something is bad or not working, you can soften it by using <strong>seem to</strong> or <strong>appear to</strong>.</p>\n<p>The form is <strong>seem to + infinitive +</strong> <strong>the problem</strong></p>\n<p>Often, the infinitive is <strong>be</strong>. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sorry, there <strong>seems to</strong> <strong>be</strong> a problem with the radio.</li>\n<li>Excuse me, there <strong>appears to</strong> <strong>be</strong> a problem with your ticket.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And these sentences, in the negative, take auxiliaries like <strong>can't</strong> and <strong>don't</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I <strong>can't seem to</strong> switch on the TV.</li>\n<li>There <strong>don't appear to</strong> be any slippers in the room.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This was our second special programme teaching you functional language. The first was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-1/session-4\">how to haggle</a>, in Unit 1 of this course.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, those are our two top tips for making complaints. Would you like to try your knowledge of this language? Test yourself in our quiz, next.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>... there don't seem to be any!</h3>\n<p>You've heard Rob and Catherine complaining about the lack of slippers in their rooms. Poor things, we don't want their feet to get cold! And if you're ever in the same position, we hope that the tips you learned mean you won't get cold feet either. Remember, if you want to be both polite and firm:</p>\n<p>1) Give a bit of background before you talk about the problem</p>\n<p>2) Use phrases like <strong>seem to</strong> and <strong>appear to</strong> to soften your language</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>So, now it's your turn to put this new language to the test. We're going to give you some possible problems with a hotel room, and you have to choose the answer which is both polite and firm, according to our programme! How many successful complaints can you make?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session. We hope you enjoyed it, and have no complaints.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And me, Neil. And today we're talking about ordinal numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. So numbers like <strong>first, second </strong>and <strong>third</strong>. So let's start by listening to Laurence. He's talking about his 18th birthday party. While you listen, try to answer this question: What date was his party? Here's Laurence.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Laurence<br/></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives! It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party. It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we asked you: What date was Laurence's birthday party?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. Now <strong>the twenty-fifth</strong> is an ordinal number like <strong>the</strong> <strong>first</strong> and <strong>the</strong> <strong>second</strong>. Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group - the dates in a month, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or which birthday it is. Laurence said it was his <strong>eighteenth</strong> birthday.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, he did. Lucky him! And ordinal numbers are different to cardinal numbers. We use cardinal numbers like <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong>, <strong>three</strong> for counting and to answer the question <strong>how many</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And to make a cardinal number into an ordinal number, add the letters <strong>t-h</strong> to the end of the cardinal number. <strong>Eighteen - eighteenth; sixty - sixtieth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And that works for all the cardinal numbers except for <strong>first, second </strong>and<strong> third</strong> – they're irregular, but for all the others, it's add <strong>t-h, </strong>so that's<strong> fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Eighth, ninth, tenth</strong>. So that's good but in writing we do have a couple of irregular spellings, such as <strong>fifth:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>f-i-f-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>eighth</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>e-i-g-h-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>ninth</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>n-i-n-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>twelfth</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>t-w-e-l-f-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And for numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>like <strong>sixty</strong>, drop the <strong>-y</strong> and add <strong>-i-e </strong>and<strong> -t-h </strong>to make<strong> sixtieth:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>s-i-x-t-i-e-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's look more closely at dates. Listen for the date in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>The twenty-fifth of May</strong>. When we say the day before the month, we always use the words <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>: <strong>the twenty-fifth of May</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But when we say the month before the day, we don't use the word <strong>of</strong>. It's just <strong>May the twenty-fifth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We often use the word <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers, but we can also use possessives. In this next clip, Laurence uses the possessive adjective <strong>my</strong> before <strong>eighteenth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></strong>It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, now we have two more ways of using ordinal numbers: space and quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, we do. And <strong>the third floor</strong> tells us about the position of the floors in space. It's the same as when we give directions, for example: <strong>Take the second left after the traffic lights.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>second prize</strong> tells us about the quality. And a point to make here is that ordinal numbers can be used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the. </strong>Like in the phrase <strong>he won second prize. Second </strong>is an adjective.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And now it's quiz time! Number one: Which of these is correct? The party's on: a) thirtieth of July b) the thirtieth July c) the thirtieth of July.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's c) the thirtieth of July.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Great! Now, number two. Which word in this list is wrong? First, second, third, ford, fifth.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>The answer's <strong>ford</strong>. It should be <strong>fourth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it should! Number three: Which of these is correct? a) My twenty-first birthday b) My the twenty-first birthday c) The my twenty-first birthday.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The answer's a) My twenty-first birthday.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done if you got them right. But before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Try saying your own important and memorable dates in English, for example, birthdays, anniversaries and festivals. If the dates are important, you're more likely to remember the English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

They are used for:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Dates</strong><br/><em>It's <strong>the twelfth of November</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>2. The order of events</strong><br/><em>Her <strong>fiftieth birthday</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>3.

Order of quality</strong><br/><em>The <strong>first prize</strong> in the competition</em></p>\n<h3>Spelling and form</h3>\n<p>We usually form ordinal numbers by adding -<strong>th</strong> to cardinal numbers:<br/><strong>four - fourth<br/></strong><strong>first, second</strong> and <strong>third</strong> are irregular forms<br/><strong>fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth </strong>and numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>have irregular spellings: <strong>twentieth</strong></p>\n<p>We say dates with <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>:<br/><strong><em>the eighth of</em></strong><em> Apr</em><em>il</em><br/><em>April <strong>the eighth </strong></em></p>\n<p>But we don't write them like that. We write them as:<br/><strong><em>8th April</em></strong><br/><strong><em>April 8th</em></strong><br/><strong><em>8 April</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>First, second</strong> and <strong>third</strong> have the irregular suffixes <strong>1st, 2nd </strong>and<strong> 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>We usually use the definite article <strong>the</strong> with ordinal numbers:<strong><br/></strong><em>on <strong>the third</strong> day</em><br/><em>It was <strong>the first</strong> time I've ever been to France</em></p>\n<p>But sometimes we use possessives:<br/><em><strong>my thirtieth</strong> birthday</em><br/><em><strong>Julia's second</strong> child</em></p>\n<p>Ordinal numbers are also used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the</strong> or a possessive adjective.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>That's the <strong>first</strong> activity over and done with. We hope you liked listening to 6 Minute Vocabulary. On to the <strong>second </strong>activity now - have a go at an ordinal numbers spelling quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Eigth, eigthth, eighth?</h3>\n<p>As you heard in 6 Minute Vocabulary, spelling some ordinal numbers can be tricky. Take another look at our guidelines, and then try our spelling quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Spelling</h3>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> We usually form ordinal numbers by adding the suffix <strong>-th</strong> to cardinal numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>four - fourth</strong></li>\n<li><strong>eleven - eleventh</strong></li>\n<li><strong>thirty-seven - thirty-seventh</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> If we are writing using numbers, which we often do for dates and numbers over 10, we simply add the suffix <strong>-th</strong> to the number:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4th</strong></li>\n<li><strong>11th</strong></li>\n<li><strong>37th</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> One, two and three have irregular forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>first, second, third </strong></li>\n<li><strong>1st, 2nd, 3rd</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> So do five, eight, nine, and twelve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth </strong></li>\n<li><strong>5th, 8th, 9th, 12th</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Numbers ending in <strong>-y</strong> have irregular spellings. They drop the <strong>-y</strong> and replace it with <strong>-ieth:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>twentieth, fortieth, seventieth</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Large numbers also follow this pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>the hundredth time</strong></li>\n<li><strong>the thousandth man</strong></li>\n<li><strong>every billionth customer</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you remember all those rules? Prove your spelling power in our quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Now it's time to test how well you know how to use ordinals in dates, and how to use them with articles and possessives. Ready?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Dates and ordinals</h3>\n<p>So far you've listened to 6 Minute English and practised spelling ordinal numbers. Now let's practise using dates correctly.</p>\n<p>This is where Marcus comes in. He's a very disorganised man. He's always losing his diary and getting confused about dates. Which is bad for him - but good for us, because it lets us practise more ordinals!</p>\n<p>We're going to read a short story about Marcus, then answer some questions. But first, let's review:</p>\n<h3><span><span>Remember</span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>We often <strong>say</strong> dates with <strong>the </strong>and <strong>of</strong>: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>the eighth of April </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But we can also say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><strong><span>April the eighth </span></strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span>(And<strong> April eighth </strong>in American English)</span></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>But we don't write them like that. We write them as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>8th April </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>April 8th </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><strong><span>8 April </span></strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span>(On the BBC website we use the last kind in news reports)</span></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>We usually use the definite article <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span>on<strong> the first evening </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\">The<strong><span> second time </span></strong>I tried sushi</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>But sometimes we use possessives: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>my seventieth birthday </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li><strong><span>Bob's second </span>car</strong></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read Marcus' story and then answer the questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions 1-3 will test spoken forms</li>\n<li>Questions 4-5 will test written forms of dates</li>\n<li>Questions 6 and 7 will look at ordinals with possessives</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will only be one possible correct answer each time.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><span><span><span><span>Poor Marcus. Well, let's hope his bad memory means his wife gets more presents, not fewer!</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span><span><span>Please note</span></span></span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Although you selected some different written forms in the test, we recommend you don't mix different forms in your essays or business communications. You should pick one form - and stick to it. Consistency is much more professional.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>End of Session 1</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>And that's the end of the <strong>first</strong> session in this unit. We hope you enjoyed it, and that you now feel a bit more confident about using ordinals in English.</span></span></p></div>",

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>Now, Catherine, would you like to have some of this delicious chocolate I've got here? </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Oh Neil, I'd love to but I can't. When I eat chocolate, I get terrible headaches. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>Oh that's bad luck! If I eat a lot of chocolate, I just get fat! </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Do you? You don't look it, you look thin!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>It's all the cycling you see. I can eat whatever I want because of all the cycling.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Lucky you.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, in this programme, we're looking at the zero conditional and the first conditional.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>We'll be discussing why and when we use them.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll see how to form them...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>We'll help you decide which one to use in which situation...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>And we'll bring you a quiz at the end of the show.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So listen carefully - and take some notes!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>Let's start by looking at the zero conditional. We use it to talk about things which always happen in particular situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>For example,<strong> I always get a headache if I eat chocolate.</strong> We also use the zero conditional to talk about facts and truths. And here's Finn with our first example.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong><strong>If you drop an apple, it falls to the ground.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>That's gravity for you! Now, there are two parts to the sentence. The part with <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>present simple</strong> tells us the situation, and the other part is in the present simple tense, and tells us what happens as a result of the<strong> if</strong> situation. Here's Finn with an example of the <strong>if</strong> situation:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong><strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>\n<p>And I'll say that again: <strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And the result:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Once more:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>And this result happens every time the situation happens. Isn't that right, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>That's correct Neil. It's a scientific fact - and it was first identified by Isaac Newton, I believe.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>I think you're right! So that's the zero conditional. Let's compare it with an example of the first conditional. Finn.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And once again:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Now, in this sentence the <strong>if</strong> plus present simple part gives us a possible future situation. The other part is made with <strong>will</strong> plus an <strong>infinitive</strong> <strong>without 'to'</strong> and it gives us the result of this possible future situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>And this is only a possible situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And this is the result of the situation. We use <strong>will</strong> to show we are certain that the glass will break. But it only breaks if we drop the glass.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>When we are less certain of the result we can use <strong>might</strong>, like this: </p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And once again:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>It's sometimes difficult to choose between the zero and first conditional. It helps to remember that as well as using the zero conditional for truths, we also use it for general situations. If you're talking about a specific situation, or a one-off situation, the first conditional is probably best. For example, to describe a general situation that is true for everyone, we can use the zero conditional to say:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you get burned.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But if your friend is about to go sunbathing, perhaps without any sun cream, you can use the first conditional to talk about that specific situation and its possible result, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you will get burned.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>And it's quiz time! Are these sentences grammatically correct, or wrong? Here's the first one: When we're older, we'll go travelling.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>OK, this first conditional sentence is correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Good. Here's another one: If plants don't get water, they die. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>This sentence is correct too. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>OK, get ready for the last sentence: If I fail my exams again, I feel terrible. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>And that's wrong. It's a specific situation and it's describing a possibility, not a certainty. So we need the first conditional. Here's the correct sentence:<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>  <br/>If I fail my exams again, I<strong> will </strong>feel terrible.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Now, before we go, there's just enough time for a top tip. The first conditional only has one 'will'. So this sentence is wrong:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>  <br/>If <strong>they will leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>You need to use present simple without will in the <strong>if</strong> part. Here's the correct version:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>  <br/>If <strong>they leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Thank you Finn. So that's the zero conditional, with the present tense in both parts, for things which always happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>And that's the first conditional with <strong>if</strong> plus present simple, together with <strong>will</strong>, plus an infinitive, for possible future situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong>Both</strong> <br/>Bye.</p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>... you'll get better!</h3>\n<p>If you practise, you'll get better... I'm sure you agree with that statement. But is it the zero or first conditional? That's the grammar we're looking at in this session.</p>\n<p>Let's start by comparing the two, then we'll do a test to see how well you know the form. </p>\n<h3>If / when + result</h3>\n<p>Conditional sentences have two parts: the <strong>if</strong> or <strong>when</strong> part and the result <strong>(main)</strong> part.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When she eats</strong> too much cake, <strong>she feels</strong> bad. (zero conditional)</li>\n<li><strong>I'll take</strong> my swimsuit <strong>if we go</strong> to the beach. (first conditional)</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Zero conditional</h3>\n<p>We use this to talk about things that are always true, whether they are scientific fact or personal beliefs. Both parts are in the present simple.</p>\n<p>The zero conditional uses <strong>if / when</strong> <strong>+ present simple</strong>, and <strong>present simple</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If</strong> <strong>I drink</strong> milk, <strong>I get</strong> a stomachache.</li>\n<li><strong>When you take</strong> exercise, <strong>your heart beats</strong> faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I</strong> <strong>feel</strong> upset <strong>when</strong> <strong>he</strong> <strong>doesn't answer</strong> my calls.</li>\n<li><strong>If you</strong> <strong>mix</strong> white and yellow<strong>,</strong> <strong>you don't get</strong> orange.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What comes </strong>out of a volcano<strong> when it erupts</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>First conditional</h3>\n<p>We use this to talk about things which might happen if an action takes place. We use <strong>if</strong> for things which are likely to happen and <strong>when</strong> for things which are certain to happen.</p>\n<p>It uses <strong>if</strong> <strong>/ when</strong> <strong>+ present simple</strong>, and <strong>will + infinitive (without 'to')</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I'll do</strong> the cooking this evening <strong>if it's</strong> OK with you.</li>\n<li><strong>When they finish</strong> work, <strong>they'll go</strong> home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I won't wait</strong> for you, <strong>if you're</strong> late again.</li>\n<li><strong>When we go</strong> camping, <strong>we won't</strong> take our laptops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where will he live when he moves</strong> to the city?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>if / when</strong> part can also come second in zero and first conditional sentences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I get a stomachache <strong>if</strong> I drink milk.</li>\n<li>They'll go home <strong>when</strong> they finish work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>That's a brief introduction to the form. So do you think you can spot sentences which are grammatically correct and wrong? Find out in our test!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next it's time to test how well you can use them. When do you use the zero and when do you use the first conditional?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Which conditional do you use, if you want to get it right?</h3>\n<p>Now that you've had a look at the form of the zero and first conditionals, let's think about choosing the right one to use.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Facts</h3>\n<p>When we talk about things that are considered as facts, we use the <strong>zero conditional</strong>. We also use this form for things that we believe are always true.</p>\n<p><strong><em>When you take</em></strong><em> exercise, <strong>your heart beats</strong> faster.<br/></em><strong><em>If I drink</em></strong><em> milk, <strong>I get</strong> stomachache.<br/></em><br/>And we can use<strong> if </strong>or<strong> when </strong>with the same meaning:</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you take </em></strong><em>exercise,<strong> your heart beats </strong>faster.<strong><br/>When I drink</strong> milk,<strong> I get</strong> stomachache.</em></p>\n<h3>Possibilities</h3>\n<p>If we want to talk about something which might happen as the result of an action or situation, we use the <strong>first conditional</strong>. We use <strong>if</strong> for things which are likely to happen and <strong>when</strong> for things which are more certain to happen.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If I see</em></strong><em> Freddy later, I’<strong>ll give</strong> him the book. </em>(I’m not certain I’ll see him.)<em><br/></em><strong><em>When I see</em></strong><em> Freddy later, I’<strong>ll give </strong>him the book. </em>(I’m certain I’ll see him.)</p>\n<p><strong><em>If we go</em></strong><em> to the beach, I’<strong>ll take </strong>my swimsuit. </em>(It isn’t certain we’ll go to the beach.)<strong><em><br/>When we go</em></strong><em> to the beach, I’<strong>ll take </strong>my swimsuit.</em> (It is certain we’ll go to the beach.)</p>\n<h3>Changes in meaning</h3>\n<p>Be careful! Sometimes you can use the zero or first conditional and both sentences sound acceptable and are grammatically correct. But which conditional form you use changes the meaning of the sentence and the context you're using it in. Take a look at the two examples in the picture.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>get</strong> burned. </em>(Zero conditional)<em><br/><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>will get</strong> burned. </em>(First conditional)</p>\n<p>In this case, it is important to think about what you are trying to say. Is it something that is generally true - like the zero conditional sentence? Or is it something that is the result of an action or situation - like the first conditional sentence? Here is an explanation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>get</strong> burned. </em>(This is something that is generally true - too much sun gives people sunburn.)<em><br/><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>will get</strong> burned. </em>(This is the possible result of an action - like you are giving a friend some advice about being in the sun too long.)</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Right! Here is a quiz to test how well you understand the use of the zero and first conditionals. Can you work out which to use?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Your knowledge of zero and first conditional form and meaning should be pretty good now! And if you keep studying this session, you will find 6 Minute Grammar! It's in the next activity - Neil, Catherine and Finn will help you make sense of all your conditional learning.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Zero and first conditionals</strong></h3>\n<p>Neil and Catherine take a look at the zero and first conditionals. Learn how to make them and when to use them, listen to some example sentences and test what you've learnt in the quiz at the end of the programme.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Grammar from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-5/downloads\">Unit 5 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/6min_gram\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>End of Session 2</strong></h3>\n<p>That's all for this session.

You've joined us at an exciting time in the history of Tip Top Trading - the leading manufacturer of plastic imitation fruit. There's been some restructuring and Paul, the boss, has gone and been replaced by a new dynamic manager, Anna, who has some big ideas...</br></p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Morning everyone. Hope you all had a lovely weekend...</p>\n<p>[everyone grunts a reply] </p>\n<p>...good, good. Now I've been thinking over the weekend...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah, yeah, she has - but not about what to cook for dinner or where to go on holiday!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Hmm Tom, we might be married now but let's not talk about personal matters in the office. No as I was <em>trying</em> to say, I was thinking about how to make our life in the office better. We need to talk more...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Doesn't Denise do enough talking already?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Thank you Tom.  No, I think we need to mix you all up a bit... so it's time to try hot desking.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>Hot desking?! You mean not having my own desk? Just sitting at whichever one is free? I can't do that! I'd have to move my staplers and my rubbers and pens and souvenir snow globe from Egypt.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Yeah... and what about my bad back? I can't keep changing desks every day...</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Come on Anna, it's time to take control. Stop them moaning - get them to love your new idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>But how? What can I say?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Well, be polite but be firm and say things like...</p>\n<p><strong>It would be great if you could</strong> try it.<br/><strong>I'd really appreciate it if you could</strong> have a go for a trial period. </p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Right thanks - I'll have a go.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>That's the spirit Anna!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So Anna - yeah, this hot desking is your 'big idea' yeah? I've never known it work before and, quite frankly, it's going to be a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Tom, you remember when I cooked rhubarb crumble for you and you said you'd never eat anything red?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah... so?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Well, you gave it a try - in the end you liked it, didn't you?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Well... erm... [lost for words]</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Well, <strong>it would be great if you could</strong> give this idea a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>But I like my desk - I get to look out of the window at all the hunky builders.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>You don't Denise?!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Look Denise - <strong>I'd really appreciate it if you</strong> would have a go... for a trial period. So come on... stand up everyone... let's hot desk... [small commotion/groans]</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>[grumpily] I'll just put my things in this box shall I...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>[moving around] Denise, I'll go and sit in your chair then - just for today. [sitting down] Ooo, your chair feels hot - is that why they call it <em>hot</em> desking?! Oi, you've left your snow globe behind. [starts to shake it] Ooh!</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>I'll take that thank you Tom... and what about you Anna? Are you still going to sit in your cosy warm office?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>No Denise - I'm going to lead by example - I'm going to hot desk too - I'm going to sit... erm... over here... oh dear!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Are you OK Anna - you sound shocked?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong><em>This</em> desk is filthy - there are crumbs all over it and... old coffee cups too. Oh dear.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>I think you need to lay down some ground rules about keeping desks tidy.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Ground rules?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>The basic rules that everyone needs to follow.

Getting on with our day-to-day tasks is difficult enough without having to deal with other people’s bad behaviour. Here’s an article that looks at the difficult people we may have to work with – colleagues from hell – and shares some tips about how to deal with them.</p>\n<p>While you’re reading, decide which of these is the main conclusion of the article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to learn to live with difficult colleagues - it's part of the job. </li>\n<li>Talk through problems with difficult colleagues - it might help the situation.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>We all have to work together</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can choose our friends, but we can't always choose our colleagues - and that can cause big problems. Today's <strong>open-plan offices</strong> make it easy to meet up with colleagues and <strong>collaborate</strong> on projects - but there's a <strong>downside</strong> to working closely together. The open-plan office makes it much harder to avoid people who have difficult or <strong>disruptive</strong> personalities. One recent high-profile case of co-worker problems featured BBC Top Gear presenter, Jeremy Clarkson. He reportedly <strong>abused</strong> a producer who failed to provide him with a hot meal after filming. Star cricketer Kevin Pietersen is another celebrity who has upset the people he works with: his teammates in the England international cricket team. Clarkson and Pietersen are valuable in their own ways – they are a huge <strong>draw</strong>. But many people believe that celebrities shouldn't <strong>get away with</strong> bad behaviour just because they are talented or popular - and it seems that their employers agree. Clarkson's contract wasn't renewed and Pietersen is off the England team, at least<strong> for the time being</strong>.</p>\n<h3>When they wind us up</h3>\n<p>So what about the office environment? You may not share office space with Clarkson or Pietersen, and there are plenty of benefits to working together, but people working side by side might irritate each other by their behaviour. Office <strong>gripes</strong> include: colleagues eating smelly food, untidiness, raised voices, poor <strong>personal hygiene</strong> and even rude behaviour. There might be <strong>inane</strong> conversation about what was on TV the night before, or you might be forced to listen to colleagues arguing on the phone.</p>\n<p>Most people would agree that it is very difficult, even impossible, to listen to what two people are saying at the same time. When other people are talking and you are trying to work, you can forget about concentrating on the task you are doing. A 1998 study in the British Journal of Psychology also found that background noise containing <strong>irrelevant</strong> speech affected workers' ability to memorise prose and do mental arithmetic.</p>\n<h3>Top tips for dealing with difficult people</h3>\n<p>So what should you do if you have to work with the colleague from hell? How can you get them to change their behaviour? And if your difficult colleague is liked by others at your workplace, can you air your grievances? We asked our audience on social media for advice. Here are five top tips inspired by their comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to be friendly to them and give them advice. If you explain to them how their actions are affecting other people, they might change their behaviour.</li>\n<li>Don't use bad language or behaviour yourself. Always <strong>maintain</strong> your professional <strong>dignity</strong> whatever your colleague does.</li>\n<li>You shouldn't let their behaviour <strong>influence</strong> what you do. Just because they are rude or aggressive, it doesn't mean that you can act the same way yourself.</li>\n<li>Keep smiling! Don't let them get you down! If they annoy you, count to ten and breathe deeply before you react.</li>\n<li>Just ignore them. They are not worth the time and effort to deal with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's no doubt that it is not always easy for us to get on with our work colleagues, but for many of us there is no <strong>alternative</strong>. Dialogue with the people we have to work with is the way to make sure that it doesn't get too bad. Here's to a happier, more productive workplace!</p>\n<h3>Did you work out the main conclusion?</h3>\n<p>It was: Talk through problems with difficult colleagues - it might help the situation.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Time to tackle those tricky colleague questions. Have a go at this quiz to check your understanding of this article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now you've read about dealing with difficult co-workers, it's time to tell us your stories. Go to the next activity and share your experiences about your own tricky colleagues.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Over to you!</h3>\n<p>You've read about dealing with difficult colleagues in general, so now it's your turn to tell us your experiences. Have you ever had to put up with a tricky co-worker? Tell us about it!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you have a colleague who really winds you up? Do they distract everyone when you're trying to work? Write down a description and try to use this unit's grammar and vocabulary as much as you can.</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Mona, Egypt</h3>\n<p>I used to have this co-worker who was bugging me all the time, sticking her nose into my business and it went too far till she deliberately made my manager angry with me. I couldn't bare it any longer. I was overwhelmed with this trouble-maker behaviour and that's when I asked her frankly to stop nagging me. I believe if I hadn't done that, she would have never stopped. </p>\n<h3>Rita, Spain</h3>\n<p>I remember the last company where I worked in. I'd not say I had tricky colleagues there but they got me down because their only interest was to give a wonderful  company appearance  to the customers while the quality level of our products was quite bad, at least at the beggining.</p>\n<p>I was the only technical worker in a marketing department, sometimes they manteined conversations about inane themes while i had to help a customer on the phone with problems relating our hardware or software. I had to ask them to lower their volume to be able to hear the customer at the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>I think everything would have been much easier if I had worked in R+D department or production department. I would say it was a question of \"tricky department\" instead of tricky colleagues.</p>\n<h3><strong>Rodrigo, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>I work in Brazil and here we have all the situations mentioned in the article, mainly unimportant conversations during work time. The productivity is not really our strength point.</p>\n<p>Our present economic situation is very bad and I hope people understand the need of higher productivity to tackle the moment.</p>\n<h3>Vladimir, Russia</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of communication problems with our co-workers at work. Bad-tempered colleagues usually irritate and annoy us, their disruptive personality usually gets us down. The perfect advice can be only one - try to put off with them. We should collaborate on tasks together to find the point of collaboration. This is an idea. In my working life I usually have to cope with great stress and sometimes people behaviors are irrational and difficult to understand, but I always do my best to get on with them for the future relations and projects. You never know today what will be tomorrow!</p>\n<h3>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>It is true that we can choose the friends but we cannot choose our colleagues and there are always some difficult ones among them that we have to put up with in our working life.</p>\n<p>I used to have a good job but I quit it however good the pay was. The reason was very simple: there was a hard smoker in the office. He often broke the etiquette \"no smoking in the office\". \"You save money if you stop smoking\" we advised him, \"Your lung will be damaged if you smoke too much\" we warned him. He did not give up his habit. \"It would be great if you could stop smoking in the office\", \"Would you mind smoking outside the office\", \"We would appreciate it if you could keep our office free from smoke in one single day\"... we requested him politely. We tried lots alternatives and expected that he stopped smoking for his health and us as well. But we failed and I quit the job because I was clearly aware of negative influence of passive smoking and I did not want to be killed by his smoke.</p>\n<p>I personally believe that every ones have to put up with colleagues from hell. Some people chooses to learn to live with. Others choose to quit as me. How’s about you? </p>\n<h3>Gian Piero, Italy</h3>\n<p>Almost everyone had to cope with some difficult colleagues in his worklife. As for me, I always tried getting on well with all of them, thinking that it was part of the job. A few years after, when I was entrusted with the management and responsibility of the office,  then I believed it was my assignment to try changing someone's behavior. Not publicly, but face to face in a polite way. I was lucky and I succeeded in the task.</p>\n<h3>Gerard</h3>\n<p>For my first job, I worked for an air plane company and discovered the hot desking.</p>\n<p>In fact, I really appreciated it because I was young, so it was a way to meet people.</p>\n<p>My job was to answer phone calls and I remembered that we had fun. Between two phone calls, we could laugh and also make fun of our clients.</p>\n<p>But today, It might be different. I would not bear people who don't respect the work of their collegues, speaking too much high, eating dirtily or having bad behaviour.</p>\n<p>I'm completely agree with the fact that we have to put up with and try to improve situation trying to ignore them or understand them. If It would be today, I would appreciate a personal desk.</p>\n<p>I love meet people but only when I decide it. For my opinion, we should not have friends at work, it might cause problems. If I had choice, I would not work in open space offices.</p>\n<h3>Jose</h3>\n<p>Well, you know it's not really easy to share habits with your colleagues. At the beginning of the article was the key: you can choose your friends but you can't choose your co-workers.</p>\n<p>I remember a colleague who left the office and she went to buy a lot of things for home. There was another one who told everybody a lot of lies every day. Nowadays, there's a colleague who have snack and lunch at the desk cutting the bread with a knife and drinking some beer. Yes, it's completely true. Also he's a rude man. But I'd rather say that the most of my colleagues have been really great, polite and patient with me.</p>\n<h3>Olga, Russia</h3>\n<p>Sometimes life might turn so funny side. We are talking about our colleagues who have bad personality or don't use personal hygiene. But we don't think about one thing that we could be exactly this colleague from a hell.</p>\n<p>I used to work in the office where was a common kitchen. One day I brought a very smelly fish. I understood this fact only when I began to eat it. Of course the smell was going around all our office. It was so embarassing and I tried to do something. The worse thing was that my boss came to the kitchen and asked loudly without any etiquette \"What's smell so bad and who did it?\". No one did not answer, but my face was so red!!! I thought that I lost my dignity.</p>\n<p>The funny thing that  my boss brings very smelly food everyday and nodody can't say to him anything because of shying. Just we wait when he finishes to eat and than open the windows and joke behind his back. When I was on his situation, I would like that someone tell me something like: \"I'd really approciate it if you could eat so nice food at your home\" and \"Would you mind helping to make air more fresh?\". And we could laugh about this situation together.</p>\n<h3>Anderson, Bogota, Colombia</h3>\n<p>We are 12 persons in the office, but I have one partner that always smell really bad, I want to say her something about it but is really embarrassing, in fact she is a beautiful woman and she actually works just by my side, I'm tired of the situation and is absolutely frustrating that one person so beautiful had this bad habits.</p>\n<h3>Suzy</h3>\n<p>We were only two in the office but when I began to work with my colleague, I had problems.</p>\n<p>When the phone was ringing... she was always the first to answer... and she shouted... For me, it was quite impossible to have a speech normally speaking!</p>\n<p>I knew she lived with her mother who was hard of hearing... One day, I said: \"it will be great if you could speak less strong at the phone...\" She agreed... but she forgot often... I had to remind her of: \"Do you mind speaking gently!\"</p>\n<p>Now, I am retired and these are old memories... but she still shouts with other younger colleagues!</p>\n<h3>Taras</h3>\n<p>Once I was forced to work with a person who really winded me up. On the first day of my work I asked him where the box is. And instead of  just saying where it is he started to call the box and say swear words. He abused me and after it I decided that it is better just to avoid him or try to have less conversation with him. And I want to say that it's really working. But it isn't always a right way. I had opportunities to avoid the difficult person but there are kind of jobs where you don't have such opportunities. So we should to search alternative ways to get on with our workmates.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>I don't know whether I am a very lucky person or a too tolerant one, but I must confess that I have never had any colleagues winding me up. Generally, if you are too tolerant, your colleagues take advantage of you. But fortunately my colleagues are very polite and I don't have to do any effort to get on with them. Obviously, the office is quite noisy sometime due to ringing telephones, arguing people, photocopiers and things like that, but if you think that every working day comes to an end, you will be able to put up with anything. Or almost.</p>\n<h3>Eşref, Turkey</h3>\n<p>I’m working in an open-plan office where we are 17 people work together. It is impossible not to be a colleage who wind up you. One of them really behave badly and irritate me. He wants to answer the phone firstly, and speaks loudly. Shortly everyone is being annoyed his behaviour. So firstly I warned him off his behaviours and loudly speech. For a short time he tries to come calm, but later returns his natural situation. At the end he didn’t change their behaviour, but I used to him.</p>\n<h3>Regiane</h3>\n<p>I work with someone with a really bad behaviour. This person could never mind using his extension to call someone (from another room) to asks something...He needs to shout, thus everybody knows what he wants. This guy does not mind using a couple of words like \"excuse me\" before entering in the others conversation. He talks so loud on the phone that disturbes everybody in the office.</p>\n<p>I am really thankful that we do not have an open-plan office, because it could be worst. Our office is so calm and peacefull when he is out... Eventually, all we need to do is to keep calm and learn how to deal with these colleagues, because does not matter where you go, they will be there.</p>\n<h3>Cristina, Spain</h3>\n<p>Once, I was working in a pub as a waitress and I had to deal with a pessimist-old-woman who works alongside me three days a week (the rest of the week I worked with a fabulous colleague). Her behavior really winds me up! She was all the time telling me stories about their family, which were irrelevant and inane. Moreover she made me sad, because she didn’t like working in a pub, so she criticized the costumers all the time, like: \"Children are all the time messing all up! They are so cheeky!\" Additionally, she was really clumsy, she used to break plates, and then she blamed me! I couldn't believe it. I tried to ignore her, but it was very hard.</p>\n<h3>Henry</h3>\n<p>It was a nightmare to work with a bitchy colleague. I once had a colleague who kept talking about her boyfriend. However, what she wanted was the colleagues' agreement with her. She would be in fury whenever we gave comments to what she said.</p>\n<p>She was ruled to colleagues but well-behaved in front of her supervisors. That is why I disagreed what my other colleagues said that she was just emotional. She actually knew how to behave, she just fired on us.</p>\n<p>Luckily, eventually I left that office and I don't need to work together with her anymore.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>I might tell you that in my current job, I have co-workers that always make irrelevant conversations by whatsApp or Facebook while we work. I think that this behavior is disruptive for our company. Our productivity have bad results when we waste the time. for this reason some companies began to prohibit this devices during working hours.</p>\n<h3>Manuel, Spain</h3>\n<p>I'm completely sure everyone has lived, worked or married a hell colleague.</p>\n<p>I'm a very active person, always trying to improve our working place and reducing risks. Lazyness is the worst behaviour to deal with. I think on my office as a common ground where develop the projects the managers set on us to guarantee our future and improve salaries</p>\n<h3>Peter</h3>\n<p>There is no alternative for me to live with my co worker. She is really talkative and incooperative. She is older than me 5 years old. When I was a new comer she has alredy worked for the company for 5 years. She always want to leave the office early for picking up her baby in the kindergarten so. But she always get away with leaving office early because she is a niece of our Deputy Executive officer. Sometimes I feel stressed because she is really lazy. All of work has been solved by me, she always talk about some inane topic. But I have to collaborate with her because my job is good.</p>\n<h3>Erika</h3>\n<p>When I was working back in Brazil I used to work in open-plan office, it was really hard because most of my colleagues were non sense . Many of them used to speak so loud and others used to eat smelly food in their office desk.</p>\n<p>One day I was talking with a client on the phone and people around me were talking out loud about an inane subject, not related to work so I had to ask them very nicely to speak lower because it was interfering with my conversation with the client. I remember me saying: \"guys would you mind talking in a lower voice please?\" They got all surprised and understood my point of view and they all got back to work instantly, since that day I had no problems dealing with them and they respected me some much more.</p>\n<h3>Juan Manuel, Spain</h3>\n<p>This really is a tricky issue for almost everybody.Wherever we go we may find people who don't agree with us: different behaviors, different feelings,different points of view. I think we all have sometimes had that sort of experiences. It seems we people are this way,each one different to the other, and sometimes we coincide and have similar feelings and other times we don't.<br>I have had hard arguments around work colleagues. Maybe the best way managing this situations is to accept them. Elsewhere we can find people who disturb us, even though ourselves can be disturbing too. It's necessary each one to find the best response to that fact. It could be a good beginning being friendly, assertive and giving explanations.</br></p>\n<h3>Francois</h3>\n<p>I worked 40 years and I haven't had many colleagues whose the behaviour was really bad. I remember that once I had a colleague who didn't smell good. As I was his manager, I had to deal with that. At first, I didn't know how to do. Then I decided to have a word with him and explain what could be the consequences for his colleagues. He was clever enough to figure out what I wanted to tell him and he changed his behaviour in the next days. Hadn't he been so smart, would I have managed to solve that problem? I wonder.</p>\n<h3>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I think that most of us have to put up a colleague that winds us up. It's a very bad situation when someone affects your work. For example: if someone smokes in the office, my eyes start hurting and I try show him that his behavior is disruptive. In a polite way,  I ask if he would mind smoking outside the office. I advice him that smoking is too bad to health. </p>\n<h3>Daniela, Italy </h3>\n<p>Working with people isn't simple as you can imagine when you go to school.</p>\n<p>In my office, for example, there were an open space and people shared everything. They discussed a lot about football on Monday morning and that got me down and annoyed. I couldn't do my work. It was necessary silence to write articles and to answer to the email and it wasn't possible in this disrupted environment!</p>\n<p>Every day I fought aginst collegue that used to talk aloud about everything he did. If  you are writing something important for your boss, you must be concentrated and his behaviour was very annoying. I put up with this fact but, gradually, I started to deal with him explain my inconvenience. I convinced him that the better way to work together was the respect of own spaces and his behaviour changed soon. Eventually, I was satisfied and I had success thanks to hard work and determination.</p>\n<h3>Nguyễn Đăng Hà </h3>\n<p>In some situations, we have to work with tricky people. It is quite uncomfortable. Some people choose to avoid talking with people that they do not like. However, in my opinion, sharing experience about the task you are doing with your collaborators can improve that task. I believe that people bahave badly because we have not understood them. Therefore, I think we should talk more to them and be firm. We can ask them more about their family or friends if possible. In my experience, some people are hard to make friends, but that does not mean impossible.</p>\n<h3>Fabio</h3>\n<p>I’m so happy with my work. My colleagues are wonderful and friendlies. However, sometimes, some of them would like being myself. It’s very interesting e funny. All the things I make are copied by them. I dont complaint about that. I like that! and this is what they dont understand. I love them! I work with them! I'm your inspirations and i like of that!</p>\n<h3>Manuel</h3>\n<p>I´m actually have a co worker (a girl) that make her everyday work like an history, she always talk loudly with another co workers, on the phone conversations and sometimes use bad language.  I did a complaint directly in a good way, but the things gone worst, she answered me with screams and bad words. I don´t have another way to have a solution for this problem, I just have to be patient and count to ten and breath.</p>\n<h3>Aqidatul</h3>\n<p>Fortunately I never really had bad experience with annoying colleague. But sometimes there are few people who had bad odor and not maintaining their personal hygiene. It was quitie irritating for me. Another thing is the laziness of a few co-workers. When we were trying to be dilligent but the same thing not happen with your colleague than it won't work either. Especially if it is a team work oriented and in workplace we seldom work alone. So maintaining a good communication with your colleague is a must.</p>\n<h3>Florent, France</h3>\n<p>I used to work with a colleague in my old company who always did my daily job instead of executing his own activities. He used to come in my office, trying to get all information on projects I was responsible for, to stand personal benefits. He often abused and irritated me because I did not get the same knowledge as him. He did not use or share any of my ideas. I tried to be friendly and maintain my professional dignity but it is very difficult to work in such conditions when a colleague does not want to change his behaviour and collaborate further.</p>\n<p>Due to his age and seniority, he had a huge draw in the company and I could not air my grievances to my boss. So, I decided to change work to meet new people. Maybe I will have to collaborate with some same disruptive colleagues but for the time being, I am ready to keep smiling and make more effort to deal with such behaviour.</p>\n<h3>Monize, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Being a doctor is not easy, and this is my job. Everyday I listen to many problems, sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it's not. So, I work with every type of person. Some patients are very difficult people and some colleagues too. They do annoying things, like be rude, not having good hygiene and being silly. They need to known that their behaviour is not productive and sometimes it causes many problems, for example: poor service, low productivity and efficiency. In health services this can cost lives. Unfortunately, in Brazil, this is a very common scenario. Being polite and aware of the benefits of good communication and social interaction makes the working environment to be more dynamic, productive, efficient and happy. No one is equal to anyone but the smooth progress of work depends on the tolerance that everyone has with their co-workers.</p>\n<h3>Antonio</h3>\n<p>I remember a colleague that I had many years ago in another Company, not the Company I’m actually working.</p>\n<p>This person had a problem, he was an alcoholic. Many days on a week, he comes drunk to the job. The work consisted in to answer phone calls from clients that had problems with their internet connection. So, as you can suppose, to be drunk is not the better way to answer a phone call. He shouted the clients, bothered female colleagues and made too much noise.</p>\n<p>It was sadly, because really this man had problems in his house. He was in a divorce process and who knows what more.  I remember most of the days the boss told him to walk around the building for pass the hang over. One day, the company fired him.</p>\n<p>This story maybe could help us about the problems that have the people around us. Normally, we haven’t seen the problems of others, we think that we are the center of the world.</p>\n<h3>Ília </h3>\n<p>I can remenber the last tricky colleague I have because it's not usual and because it's recent.<br/> I've started working in a new company in a new project and the only person working on that is my colleague that was supposed to support me in the initial phase but instead of that fakes supporting me. Do you know when somebody says something verbally and his or her body language says the opposite? If you need help if you have any doubt ask me and when I do it I hear if you had took notes you wouldn't ask me that and so on. I'm new in the company and cannot air my grievances to my boss or anybody else. For the time being she gets away with faking real support because she is older on the project and has the project's leaders trust. I have no alternative to put up with trying to have support from others that are really available and ignoring her. No matters what happens my dignity is above everything.</p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>At work, there are always colleagues who try to distract others with bad jokes, inane conversations, or even things which have no signification, and I mean not at all. Sometimes, it is really difficult to work with these kind of colleagues, but I notice that they are often very appreciated by others, what do make the problem much more complicated. And, if they are so appreciated on the other hand, it's because sometimes we need to get distracted and come back to our day-to-day tasks much better, so anyway, I think we need this type of persons. Perhaps, if we deal with them and we play along with these 'colleagues from hell', the problem will be surprisingly resolved more effectively.</p>\n<h3>Pawan, Nepal</h3>\n<p>I have had few colleagues who made things very difficult for me; they used to chat inane and irrelevant subject matter right under my nose and had disruptive personality. If i try to air my grievances to my manager, he would discard it completely saying they were seniors and ought to be respected. So, my gripes would go unheard every time i try to. Its not that i haven't tried to collaborate with them - i have tried several times. But, they don't seem affable enough. This made me very upset but i had no other alternatives than to tolerate them at work.</p>\n<h3>Oni</h3>\n<p>I have an interesting story about a tricky co-worker. At that time, I got a new job and it means I have new co-workers. In the first day, I came to the new office. There are five people in my open-plan office. I introduced myself and also they introduced their selves to me. I felt uncomfortable when all of us were doing our own job. I heard a noisy sound and it really disturbed me. And the noisy sound came from my collaborating partner because he pushed keyboard buttons too firmly and too quickly, so it was like a piano concert but had disturbing sound and inconsistent rhythm. I could not do anything at that time. However, because it always disturbed me every day, and I couldn’t focus on my job. I decided to tell him what he did annoyed me. However, I thought what way I had to do because if I told him, probably it would hurt him. Finally, I got a brilliant idea. I said to him that pushing keyboard button too firmly and  too quickly could break the laptop. And I explained what the downsides were when laptop was broken. After long explanation, he understood it and he never do that again. In the end, both of us got advantage, I helped him to be avoided at breaking his laptop and I also felt better in my office.</p>\n<h3>Antonella, Bari, Italy</h3>\n<p>I have worked for three months at the University of Salerno in a chemical laboratory.  I had to join a team and I remember one of my colleague was what I can define a tricky one. She distracted me every 5 minutes with inane conversations and she ate on the only table in the laboratory, making it very tidy. Moreover, she brought her unauthorized friends in the lab, they touched every reagent and every flask that were there, so I couldn't get on with my scientific project. In the beginning, I complained with my boss, which suggested to me to talk about these problems with her. So I followed her advice and surprisingly  it worked. If I had talked to her at the beginning, I would not have any problems and I would finish my project earlier.</p>\n<h3>Mohammad Al Afifi, Palestine</h3>\n<p>I used to have a tricky colleagues, he is very quiet and concentrate when he is doing his work , but when I am working and he is free he always interrupt me and talk about irrelevant and boring subjects.</p>\n<p>I tried to be cool and patience for long time, but after a while his behavior affected my work quality and made me nervous, and at this point I decided to en this problem, I spoke to him and explain the problem and told him to stop this behavior politely.</p>\n<p>At the end I discovered that his behavior is just a bad habit, and when he realize that he stopped it and our relation became better.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session and all those tricky colleagues!

I’m Neil…</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And I’m Finn. In this programme we’re looking at three prefixes: <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>, <strong>dys-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-y-s </strong>and <strong>dis-</strong>,spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Prefixes – or prefixes, as some people say - are two or three letters that go at the beginning of a word and affect its meaning.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We’ll look at what each prefix means and give you example sentences…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There’ll be a quiz …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But first, let’s listen to Gladys talking about her husband Bert.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: Does Gladys agree with Bert’s doctor?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Gladys<br/></span></strong><span>Bert’s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It’s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. The doctor says it’s because he eats too much fatty food. She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. No <strong>disrespect </strong>to the doctor, but I <strong>disagree</strong> - I think it’s caused by stress. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>So we asked you: Does Gladys agree with the doctor?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: No, she <strong>disagrees. </strong>Gladys thinks her husband’s indigestion is caused by stress, but the doctor thinks it’s due to a bad diet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Disagree</strong> is the key word because it has the prefix <strong>dis</strong>, spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>. This means not. So by adding <strong>dis,</strong> we can turn a word into its opposite. So <strong>dis - agree</strong> means not to agree …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and <strong>dis - respect</strong> means not having respect.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Gladys says <strong>No disrespect to the doctor </strong>– meaning she doesn’t want people to think she doesn’t respect what the doctor says<strong>.</strong> Let’s hear another clip from Gladys with more prefixes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span>Bert’s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It’s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>discomfort. </strong>If you know what the word <strong>comfort</strong> means…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… then you can work out what <strong>discomfort </strong>means: <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>comfort</strong>  give us the opposite of comfort: Bert’s feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And in the clip, we heard the word <strong>dyspepsia</strong> – that’s the medical word for indigestion, when your stomach feels very full and uncomfortable after you eat.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>This word starts with the prefix <strong>dys</strong>, but this time it’s spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>This prefix is less common than <strong>dis</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>, but it also has a negative meaning – it has the idea of being bad or abnormal.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>dyspepsia </strong>is a medical condition when your body can’t process food in the normal way.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Other words with the prefix <strong>dys-</strong> , spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>, are <strong>dyslexia </strong>and <strong>dysfunctional. </strong>People who have <strong>dyslexia</strong> have difficulty with reading…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… and if something is <strong>dysfunctional</strong>, it doesn’t work properly.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have another clip with the prefix <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>d-i-s</strong>. We’ll also hear our next prefix.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span></strong><span>She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>disappear</strong> - that’s <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>appear</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and <strong>disappear</strong>, means the opposite of <strong>appear.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We also had the word <strong>detox</strong>, which starts with the prefix <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the prefix <strong>de-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-e</strong>, usually means take away or remove something …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, if something is described as a <strong>detox</strong>, <strong>de-tox</strong>, it means it takes away toxins or poisons. A <strong>detox</strong> diet could be one with just fruit and vegetables.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I like to <strong>detox</strong> at the end of the day with a hot bath.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And we’re talking about the prefixes<strong> dis-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>;<strong> dys</strong>,spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>; and<strong> de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>All these prefixes have a negative meaning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And now it’s quiz time. Choose the correct word. Number one: One minute the dogs were playing in the garden. The next minute the garden was empty and they’d all a) disagreed b) disappeared c) detoxed.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the answer to that is b) <strong>disappeared</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Number two. People who drink too much alcohol sometimes go to a clinic for a a) dyspepsia b) discomfort c) detox.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>The answer is c) <strong>detox</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And number three: My daughter is having problems learning to read. Her teacher thinks she may be a) disrespectful b) dyslexic c) dysfunctional.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>The answer is b) <strong>dyslexic</strong>. And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, well done. And now, here’s our top tip for learning vocabulary: when you see or hear a new word, see if you can break the word up - if it starts with a prefix that you recognise, it may help you to understand the meaning.  </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>.

Adding <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>dys-</strong> or <strong>de-</strong> makes the new word have a negative meaning. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Let's look in a little more detail.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Dis-</strong> usually gives the opposite meaning. So, to <strong>disagree</strong> is the opposite of <strong>agree</strong>. <strong>Disappear</strong> is the opposite of <strong>appear</strong>. And if you know what <strong>comfort</strong> means, then you can guess what <strong>discomfort</strong> means!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Words beginning with <strong>dys-</strong> are usually medical. They're quite technical, but if your doctor says you have <strong>dyskinesia</strong> (difficulty moving normally), <strong>dysphagia</strong> (difficulty swallowing) or <strong>dyssomnia</strong> (difficulty sleeping), then you know you're not completely healthy.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>De-</strong> often has the idea of moving 'away' from something. Or, like <strong>dis-</strong>, it can also give an opposite meaning. To <strong>decentralise</strong> is to move things away from the centre (the opposite of <strong>centralise</strong>). If you <strong>deforest</strong> land, you take the trees away. And to <strong>detox</strong> is to remove toxins (harmful substances).</span></span></p>\n<p>Understanding how prefixes affect meaning is a very useful tool. Next time you see a word you don't know, have a look to see if it's made of a prefix and a word you do know. If you know the prefix, there's a good chance you guess the new word too.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>We're going to do two activities. In the first one, we'll focus on words with the three prefixes from this unit's 6 Minute Grammar. After that, we'll do one when you try to guess the meanings of difficult words. Let's begin.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next up we're going to do another activity where we bring in a few more prefixes: <strong>re-</strong>, <strong>pre-</strong>, <strong>pro-</strong>, <strong>in-</strong>, <strong>un-</strong> and <strong>mis-</strong>. How well do you know them?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Re-, pre-, pro-, in-, un-, mis-</h3>\n<p>There are lots of prefixes to learn in English. In our pre-intermediate course we looked at six more: <strong>re-</strong>, <strong>pre-</strong>, and <strong>pro-</strong> in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-24/session-1/activity-3%20\">Unit 24</a>, and <strong>un-</strong>, <strong>in-</strong> and <strong>mis-</strong> back in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-3/session-1/activity-4\">Unit 3</a>.</p>\n<p>First, let's <strong>revise</strong> the meanings of these prefixes! Later, we'll do a test.</p>\n<p><strong>1) re = again</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>reheat (heat again), reuse (use again), replay (play again), revise (look at again)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) pre = before, already</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>precooked (cooked already), prepacked (packed already), prewar (before a war)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) pro = in support of, in favour of (often followed by a hyphen)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>proactive (in favour of being active), pro-British (in favour of Britain), pro-capitalist (in favour of capitalism)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) un = not</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>unclean (not clean), unhygienic (not hygienic), unhappy (not happy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5) in = not</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>incomplete (not complete), intolerant (not tolerant), inaccurate (not accurate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6) mis = wrong, or not</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>mishear (to hear incorrectly), misunderstanding (a situation when people understand each other wrongly), mislead (to make someone believe the wrong thing)</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p><span><span>It's time to see if you can build some more vocabulary. <strong>Revision</strong> is important before an exam, as we know. Let's read about a young man called Richard as he revises for his exams. Can you fill in the gaps in the story with the correct words, even if you haven't seen them before?</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Well done. We hope that next time you see a word starting with one of these prefixes you'll feel a bit more confident, not unconfident! In Session 2 we're looking at modals of speculation and deduction, things like <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> and <strong>could</strong>...</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me Catherine. In today's programme we're having a look at modal verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now modal verbs are used in a lot of different ways but in this programme we’re looking at the modal verbs we use when we're talking about things we think are possible or true – both in the present and in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. When we don't know something for sure, we often make guesses. And modal verbs can express how sure or unsure we are about our guesses. We'll give you lots of examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we’ll check what you've learned in our quiz.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But first, we're listening to Fiona, who is a science reporter. And Fiona is talking about some ancient fossils that were found in China and Taiwan.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Are the fossils from humans?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Fiona<br/></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan <strong>could be looking</strong> at something very important. It seems that the fossils <strong>can't be</strong> from any known human species. They <strong>might be</strong> the result of breeding between species or they <strong>may belong</strong> to an unknown human species. The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups <strong>may have lived</strong> there than previously thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So that was Fiona. And we asked you: Are the fossils from humans?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: Maybe. They <strong>might be</strong> the result of breeding between species or they <strong>may belong</strong> to an unknown human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we don't know the answer for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. Now the modal verbs <strong>might</strong> and <strong>may </strong>plus an infinitive show that we're talking about a present possibility, not a certainty. The modal verb <strong>could</strong> does this too, either with an infinitive or with a continuous form. Here's an example.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan <strong>could be looking</strong> at something very important…</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>In fact, we can say <strong>could be looking, might be looking</strong> or <strong>may be looking</strong> there.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right: it's a modal verb plus the continuous form of <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>verb–ing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But what about this sentence? Listen.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong>It seems that the fossils <strong>can't be</strong> from any known human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Fiona uses the modal <strong>can’t </strong>there. Now we use <strong>can't </strong>with an infinitive when we believe strongly that something isn't possible. The researchers believe strongly that the fossils don't belong to any known human species. They <strong>can't</strong> come from a known human species – it's not possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So they <strong>must be</strong> from an unknown human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. <strong>Must </strong>or<strong> can't </strong>plus an infinitive both help us to express a strong belief that something is or isn't possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>When we're less sure about something, we can say, for example, the fossils <strong>might not, mightn’t </strong>or<strong> may not be</strong> from a known human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, but don’t use the negative <strong>couldn't</strong> like this. It's different. <strong>Couldn't</strong> plus an infinitive means that something is completely impossible. Right then. Now let's look at possibilities and certainties in the past. Here's the next clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong>The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups <strong>may have lived</strong> there than previously thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we can also use <strong>might, may, could, can't</strong> and <strong>must</strong> with <strong>have</strong> and the past participle of the verb when we think something was possible in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, we can say <strong>may have lived, might have lived </strong>or<strong> could have lived</strong> to express past possibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we use<strong> can't </strong>or <strong>must </strong>with <strong>have</strong> and the past participle when we're <strong>certain</strong> about something in the past. For example, <strong>t</strong><strong>he scientists can't have expected to find anything so important</strong>.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. <strong>They must have been very excited</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I'm sure they were!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we're talking about modal verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's quiz time! For each of these sentences, choose <strong>might</strong>,<strong> must</strong> or <strong>can’t</strong> to fill the gap: Number one: Finn, you got an A grade in physics? Wow. You _____ have studied really hard.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>must</strong>. You must have studied really hard. I did Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Very good, Finn! Number two: Nick just called. He is stuck in traffic: he _____ be late.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>And this one is <strong>might</strong>. <strong>He might be late</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done! Number three: You _____ have seen a ghost. There's no such thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>can't.</strong> <strong>You can’t have seen a ghost. </strong>There's no such thing. Is there Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I don't think so, Finn. What about you?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We don’t believe in ghosts. And that's the end of the quiz.

Mars is a dead planet, isn’t it? There <strong>must</strong> <strong>be</strong> another explanation.\"</p>\n<p>Mo replied: \"Well their information <strong>might not be</strong> completely accurate.

The room is empty except for a bed and a shelf. The room has no window, and only one door, which is locked. The room is in a house far away from others, but is close to a railway line.</p>\n<p>How did they die?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The answer</h3>\n<p>Don't read this if you're not ready! This is a well-known riddle and the answer usually given is... Romeo and Juliet are fish! They were in a glass bowl on the shelf, but this shook and fell when a train went past. It smashed on the floor and Romeo and Juliet died.</p>\n<p>But maybe you could think of another way they died?</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now it's time for 6 Minute Grammar. Finn and Catherine take a trip round the world of modal verbs.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Modals of deduction and speculation</h3>\n<p>Do you know what to say when you're making a guess about a past or present situation?

In 2011, researchers working on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya took a wrong turn and <strong>spotted</strong> sharp flakes of stone removed from larger rocks.

I'm Catherine...</br></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And I'm Neil. Today we're looking at the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>less </strong>and<strong> -</strong><strong>free.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word that affect its meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll look at what the suffixes <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-less</strong> mean and give you some examples...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There'll be a quiz...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's start by listening to Markus. He's a politician and he's talking about his party's policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right. So while you listen, think about this question: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke? Here's Markus.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves. We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones. We're going to extend the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes, which may be <strong>smokeless</strong>, but they aren't <strong>harmless</strong>, and we're going to raise the penalties for <strong>careless</strong> drivers.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> So we asked you: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And the answer is: No they don't. E-cigarettes are <strong>smokeless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And<strong> smokeless </strong>is a key word in this programme because it ends with the suffix<strong> less, </strong>spelt<strong> l-e-s-s. </strong>This means 'without'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So <strong>smokeless</strong> cigarettes are cigarettes without smoke - they don't produce any smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if something is <strong>harmless</strong>, it doesn't cause harm. Markus said that e-cigarettes are not <strong>harmless</strong>. In other words, they are dangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Markus also said his party was going to raise penalties - or increase punishments - for <strong>careless </strong>drivers - people who drive without care.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>careless </strong>means not being careful. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, by adding <strong>-less</strong> to the nouns <strong>smoke, harm </strong>and<strong> care,</strong> we turn them into adjectives. Let's hear some more examples with <strong>-less</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we had the <strong>jobless</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's people without jobs...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...the <strong>homeless</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...people who have nowhere to live. We can create a noun to describe a particular group of people, by using the word <strong>the</strong> with a <strong>­-less</strong> word. <strong>The jobless</strong>, <strong>the homeless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Lastly, we had the adjective<strong> powerless, </strong>which describes people who are unable to do certain things. If we add <strong>the</strong>, we get a group noun: <strong>the powerless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's have another clip. Listen out for the suffix <strong>-free.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We had <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong>. Now if you add <strong>-free</strong> to a noun, you get an adjective, meaning that there isn't any of that noun, or it's not allowed, or both. <strong>Car-free </strong>means there are no cars because they're not allowed. <strong>Smoke-free</strong> means smoking is not allowed and so there is no smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>free </strong>and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong>. And Neil how was your journey to work today; <strong>stress-free</strong>, I hope?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, actually, it was awful! I tried to use my <strong>contactless </strong>credit card to pay for the train, but it didn't work, so I had to walk all the way...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, won't do you any harm, Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. It's good for me, I suppose.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It is. And <strong>contactless</strong> credit cards are the cards that work without a PIN number.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Usually you use either <strong>-</strong><strong>free</strong> or <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> with a particular word. But occasionally you can use <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> interchangeably, as in <strong>sugarless</strong> and <strong>sugar-free. </strong>These both mean: without sugar.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But be very careful with the words <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree </strong>because they have very different meanings.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they do. A<strong> careless </strong>person is someone who doesn't take much care over what they're doing...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...whereas a<strong> carefree </strong>person like you, Neil, doesn't worry about anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I don't worry about a thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one: Jack looks scary, but he's actually very kind and gentle. He's a) careless b) harmless c) powerless.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>harmless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number two. Dalya doesn't check her work properly so she makes lots of mistakes. She's very a) careless  b) carefree  c) contactless.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> careless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: To cut the risk of cancer, some people smoke e-cigarettes which are a) smokeless b) smokeless-free c) smoke-free.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>smokeless.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: record yourself saying new words and then listen to them every day. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Top tip.

Of course, it's possible to be both at once!</p>\n<p>In this activity, we're going to test your knowledge of the words that have these suffixes. Sometimes a word can have either <strong>-free</strong> or <strong>-less</strong>, but be careful because this can change the meaning, as in <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree</strong>.</p>\n<p>One hint to help you is that for places where something is not allowed, we usually use <strong>-free</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Choose the correct words to complete these sentences.

Was that a <strong>stress-free</strong> experience, or did you make some <strong>careless</strong> mistakes? Next we're going to revise a few more suffixes:</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Revise -ee, -able, -ible, -ness, and job suffixes</h3>\n<p>Learning what prefixes and suffixes mean can really help you improve your vocabulary. We revised prefixes in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-6/session-1/activity-3\">Unit 6</a> of this course. Now we're going to help you feel more confident with suffixes too.</p>\n<p>We've already taught some prefixes in our Lower Intermediate course. For example, in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-1/session-1/activity-3%20\">Unit 1</a> we looked at:</p>\n<p><strong>1) ee = </strong>creates a noun meaning 'person who receives an action'</p>\n<ul>\n<li>employee, interviewee, trainee</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) able = </strong>creates an adjective meaning that the subject can do something OR that something can be done to it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>excitable, loveable, breakable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) ible = </strong>a different spelling of<strong> -able</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>responsible, visible, terrible</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) ness = </strong>creates a noun which describes a quality or state</p>\n<ul>\n<li>happiness, politeness, kindness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-10/session-1/activity-3%20\">Unit 10 </a>of our Lower Intermediate course, we looked at <strong>job suffixes</strong> - things you add to words to make them job titles.</p>\n<p><span><strong>5) job titles ending in –er</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>presenter, teacher, train driver</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>6) job titles ending in –or</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>actor (some people say actress for female actors), translator</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>7) job titles ending in –ian</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>librarian, politician, optician</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>8) job titles ending in –ist</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>journalist, receptionist, dentist</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>A loveable but excitable dog. A breakable vase. It sounds like it will end badly! Can you fill in the gaps in the story with the correct words, even if you haven't seen them before?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Well done. We hope learning suffixes has filled you heart with <strong>happiness</strong>. Or at least made you feel they're not so <strong>terrible</strong>!

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br/></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Today we're talking about the past perfect tense.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Yes, the past perfect. When we want to talk about two things that happened at different times in the past, we can use the past perfect tense - that's a subject with <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>. And here's Harry with our first example:</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And let's hear that again.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Thanks Harry. Now we could put these two events in the past simple tense, something like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And once again Harry.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Or, we can change the order of events in the sentence, and use the past perfect - that's <strong>had </strong>with a <strong>past participle</strong> - to show which event actually happened first.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>And here, the past perfect in <strong>John had gone</strong> shows that this happened before the past simple phrase <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell</strong>. So we have: <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Exactly. Now, let's look at some more examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Let's hear that again.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>So we've got two past events. First, Harry lost Jim's number; then he got his text. But in Harry's sentence, the event that happened first in time is mentioned second in the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob   <br/></strong>So he uses the past perfect - <strong>I'd lost his number</strong> - to show that the second event he mentions, actually happened first.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Now in spoken English, the past perfect can sometimes be difficult to hear. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Yes that's true - in our example just now, the two words <strong>I had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I'd</strong>. I'd lost his number. </p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a /d/ sound. Listen out for the short /d/ sound in this next example: </p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And again.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Did you catch that?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>First, Mrs Brown washed her phone in the washing machine. Then she opened the washing machine. Then she realised... She'd washed her phone!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and the phrase <strong>she had washed</strong> is shortened to <strong>she'd washed</strong>. One more time please Harry.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Oops - that's an expensive mistake. Poor Mrs Brown!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Yeah, she won't do that again!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>6 Minute Grammar from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now for a quiz. I'm going to say some sentences and, as you listen, try to decide what happened first, and what happened second. Here's the first one. <strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>OK, so the past perfect here is <strong>I'd forgotten</strong>, and the order of events was: first, I forgot to set the alarm, and second, I woke up late. Here it is again. </p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Great. Another one: <strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>How embarrassing. OK, and we've got the negative of had, which is <strong>hadn't</strong>. So first, I didn't bring a towel, and second, I couldn't have a shower. Here it is again. </p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Good. And for the last one: <strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Rob   <br/></strong>This one has three events: first, they left the tickets at home. Second, they got to the station. And third, they realised that the tickets were at home.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Yes and the past perfect phrase <strong>they had left</strong>, was shortened to <strong>they'd left</strong> - which helps us show that order.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Now, a mistake people sometimes make with the past perfect is: they use it too much, or they use it just because they are talking about something that happened a long time ago. Such as...</p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>Jackie had gone to a football match last month.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Yes - there's only one past event here, so we probably just need the past simple tense:</p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>Jackie went to a football match last month.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob   <br/></strong>So that's the past perfect. It's made of <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong> and we mainly use it to talk about a past event that happened before another past event.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Two events in the past...</h3>\n<p>In this unit we're looking at the past perfect tense. We use it when two actions or events in a sentence happened in the past, and we need to show which one happened first. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived home, my son had baked an enormous carrot cake.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this sentence, the son baked the cake first, then the parent arrived home. Did you notice how the grammar worked? Well, we're going to explore that at the bottom of this page, but first, we'd like to see how much you know already - or can work out for yourself.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First let's read this story about a woman called Roberta. She's had a terrible day. We'll look at how the past perfect works, and then we'll do an exercise to test your understanding of the past perfect tense.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>I had a terrible day today. It started badly and just got worse.</p>\n<p>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set my alarm clock. Because I was late, I ran to the train station but when I got there I realised I hadn't brought my <strong>season ticket</strong>. I missed my train.</p>\n<p>By the time I arrived at work, the staff meeting had already started. I really wanted to finish work at the usual time of 5pm because I wanted to see my favourite band at a concert. But I couldn’t leave on time because I hadn’t completed the report my boss had asked for.</p>\n<p>I left work late - and by the time I arrived at the concert <strong>venue</strong>, the band had already finished playing. I <strong>wept</strong> like a child.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Past perfect tense: Meaning and use</h3>\n<p><strong>What happened first:</strong> my son made a cake</p>\n<p><strong>What happened second:</strong> I arrived</p>\n<p>We use the <strong>past perfect part </strong>of the sentence to show which event happened first (and often the past simple to say what happened second):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived home, my son had already made an enormous carrot cake.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also change the order of events in the sentence, and still show what happened first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>My son had made an enormous carrot cake when I arrived home.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Form</h3>\n<p>The past perfect is made with <strong>subject +</strong> <strong>had/hadn’t +</strong> <strong>past</strong> <strong>participle</strong>. <br/><br/><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When my parents got to the station, they realised <strong>they had left</strong> the tickets at home. </em></li>\n<li><em>By the time Mark arrived at work, <strong>the staff meeting had already started</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>I woke up late because <strong>I’d forgotten</strong> to set my alarm clock. </em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Kerry couldn’t leave work on time because <strong>she hadn't written </strong>the report.</em></li>\n<li><em>They didn’t tell the police about the accident <strong>they had seen</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Had you finished</em></strong><em> your homework before the movie started?</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Hadn't John told</strong> them what he wanted?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important note</strong></p>\n<p>The most common mistake with the past perfect is to overuse it, or to use it simply because we are talking about a time in the distant past. The past perfect sentence <em>The Romans <strong>had spoken</strong> Latin </em>would be better in the past simple: <em>The Romans <strong>spoke</strong> Latin.</em></p>\n<p>Remember that we only use the past perfect when we want to refer to a past that is earlier than another time in the narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra tip: time expressions</strong></p>\n<p>Quite often with the past perfect we use adverbs like <strong>already</strong> and <strong>just:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived home, my sister <strong>had already made</strong> lunch.</em></li>\n<li><em>I <strong>had just taken</strong> off my coat when the telephone rang.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use time expressions like <strong>when,</strong> <strong>before</strong> and<strong> by the time</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>When</strong> I arrived at the concert venue, the band <strong>had already finished</strong> playing.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Had you finished</strong> your meal <strong>before</strong> your friend arrived?</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>By the time</strong> we got to the party all the food had gone.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now that you've seen the tense in action, it's time to use your knowledge to complete another activity. It's time to test the form!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The plane had already left...</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to test your knowledge of the past perfect form. As we said, we use the past perfect tense to show which past event happened first. The past event that happened second is usually in the past simple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By the time I got to the airport, the plane <strong>had already left</strong>.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the sentences.

The staff at Tip Top Trading – the leading manufacturer of imitation plastic fruit – are busy trying to meet a huge demand in orders for its new 'Awesome Apple' product. But there's a problem because some of the orders have not been <strong>awesome</strong>, or indeed apple…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[on the phone] Yeah, yeah calm down mate… what can I do about it? Apples, avocados, they're all the same really. <strong>I'm afraid there's nothing I could do about it</strong>. Hello… hello? He hung up on me!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Is there a problem Tom?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Oh that was old Slimey Limey – he says his order for ten thousand 'Awesome Apples' isn't right – he's received ten thousand 'Amazing Avocados' instead. I told him it's not my fault, I didn't send them out. Sorry Anna <strong>it's out of my hands now</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Well don't look at me – I haven't had anything to do with Mr Lime since… the incident.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>[mocking] 'Sorry, but it's out of my hands' – lazy Tom is trying to pass the blame. Why did you marry him Anna?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Because I… I… find him unusual. Anyway, it sounds like it's down to me to sort this out.<br/>[to the team]<br/>Look, I'm not blaming anyone – yet - but we have to sort this out. Slimey, I mean Mr Lime, is one of our biggest <strong>clients</strong>. Denise could you see if we have any more Awesome Apples in the warehouse that we can send him?</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>OK Anna – I'm onto it now.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>He sounded really angry – a bit like you when I used all the hot water in the bath this morning, Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Hmm, I haven't forgotten about that Tom.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Anna… according to our database, we're completely out of Awesome Apples – and Big Bananas and even Imperial Lemons. [panicking] What are we doing to do Anna?!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>What are you going to do Anna? It's time to do some <strong>grovelling</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Grovelling?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>To show lots of respect for him – to try to please him. Be apologetic and use phrases like…<br/><br/>I'm really sorry to let you down but…<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, but… and maybe…<br/>It's not how we planned it but…</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>But…?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>But… explain what the problem is and how are you going to fix things? It's over to you Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Anna, listen Anna… I can't ring Mr Lime and give him the bad news – I've got my… errr… <strong>reputation</strong> to think of.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Yes you've certainly got a reputation Tom!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Thank you Denise. Look, it's Tip Top Trading's reputation we've got to think about now. I'm going to have to ring him now…</p>\n<p>[dials phone]</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Sid Lime speaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Oh hello Mr Lime. It's Anna from Tip Top Trading here…</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Ah Anna, I did wonder when you would call. I see you're getting Tom to do all your <strong>dirty work</strong> now hmmm? I don't know why you ever married…</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>It's about the Awesome Apples… I'm really sorry about the mix up… someone obviously got their apples mixed up with their avocados…</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Obviously! So you'll be sending me a replacement <strong>ASAP</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Err… well that's thing… I'm really sorry to let you down but… but… we haven't got any more Awesome Apples in stock to send you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Oh no! Not so 'awesome'…</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Clearly it's not how we planned it but something has gone wrong – we normally <strong>pride ourselves</strong> on good customer service…</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Clearly!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Look, we're really sorry to disappoint you but we will be producing some more Awesome Apples in a few weeks' time and we will…. err… we will send you an extra 1,000 apples as <strong>compensation</strong>. How does that sound Mr Lime?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>[thinking it over] Hmmm, an extra 1,000 you say? OK then… and how about having dinner with me sometime as well Anna?</p>\n<p>[slams phone down]</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Well done Anna! She handled the call very well, sounding apologetic, honest and fair. Here are the phrases that helped her…<br/><br/><strong>I'm really sorry to let you down.</strong><br/><strong>Sorry to disappoint you but…</strong><br/><strong>It's not how we planned it but...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So come on then, how angry was he?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Not angry… everything is sorted, I think he'll be…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>[interrupting] Anna, I've just been looking through the paperwork from the warehouse and on the order for Slimey Limey somebody ticked 'avocados' and not 'apples'.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Let me have a look [paper rustle] ... oh, and look who signed the paperwork… Tom!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[lost for words] What?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Tom, you thought I was angry this morning – just wait until I get you home.</p>\n<p> </p> </div>",

If you want to become a pilot or a doctor, you can't just leave your current job and walk into a whole new profession.</p>\n<p>But that's not stopping people who want to make the change from one career to another.</p>\n<p>In this activity we get some tips on changing careers from former tennis player Boris Becker. Then we answer questions to see how much you've understood, and help you practise the past perfect.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the article and answer the questions.</p>\n<h3>Article</h3>\n<p><span><span>One of Boris Becker's most important victories wasn't even on the tennis court. Although he had <strong>excelled at</strong> the sport from a young age, it wasn't until he won a few competitions that his parents were convinced he was doing the right thing. \"In the mid-80s, professional sports weren't <strong>financially rewarding</strong>,\" he says.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But by the time he was 20 he had won two major <strong>titles</strong>, including being the youngest player to win Wimbledon in 1985 at the age of only 17. He was nicknamed \"Boom Boom\" thanks to his fast and aggressive style of play. He had won two more before the end of the decade, with a further two <strong>Grand Slam</strong> victories in the 1990s.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But of course at some point the tennis had to stop. And since then, Becker has become a successful businessman, with interests in <strong>real estate</strong>, finance, TV and coaching. How did he make the <strong>transition</strong>?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\"It was not easy,\" says Becker.  \"Fortunately I'd won a couple of <strong>tournaments</strong> so I didn't need to work the very next day. But I was still young and <strong>eager to</strong> get involved in areas I really cared for. I started a couple of companies and, 15 years later, I'd like to think I have a second career.\"</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>He had served as a tennis <strong>commentator</strong> with the BBC for over 10 years before <strong>taking up the role of</strong> coach to world number one Novak Djokovic in 2013. And in the summer of 2014, he guided the player to his second Wimbledon title.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But other career choices have had nothing to do with tennis. Becker is also a professional <strong>poker</strong> player. So what advice does he give people who are thinking about changing their working lives? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\"Read a lot, speak a lot to people that know more than you.\" And most importantly: \"Give yourself the time and think a lot about what you want to do with the rest of your life.\"</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\"Trust your <strong>instincts</strong>. Be surrounded by the right people. Be open-minded about it. Don't expect that every decision you make is going to be successful. Be <strong>gutsy</strong> about it.\"</span></span></p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So that's Boris Becker's advice. But what about you? In the next activity, you get your chance to tell us about a career move you made.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Tell us about it!</h3>\n<p>You've read Boris Becker's views on changing career. But while his advice about being open-minded and listening to advice might be useful, most of us aren't already famous sportspeople with a lot of prize money in our bank accounts. But nonetheless, many people do change careers.</p>\n<p>So how do you move into a new <strong>line of work</strong> when you have no experience, and can't afford to just leave your job?</p>\n<p>Many choose to get a relevant qualification through an evening or weekend course. Others do take a period of <strong>unpaid leave</strong>, others <strong>volunteer</strong> or do an <strong>internship</strong>.</p>\n<p>With good<strong> contacts</strong> and some experience <strong>under your belt</strong>, some manage to <strong>move sideways</strong> into a new profession. For others, the only option is <strong>drop a grade</strong> or two.

I've been an electronic engineer for more then eight years. But I was compelled to sit at home with my children because the crisis had happened. I've never thought that with such huge experience under my belt I need to move sideways. Nonetheless I volunteered for about three months since I hadn't excelled to find any paid job. Today I must work hard and be gutsy to convince an hypothetical employer of my capability.</p>\n<h3>Manuel, Cantabria, Spain</h3>\n<p>One of the worst aspects you job could have is the routine. You could feel tired and exhausted. Its very convenient you could change your job, you could keen on another activitie.</p>\n<p>I was working as a civil servant in an open office and I've been working since 1987 in a same job. But in 2008 I decided to improve my labour conditions and I began to work as a teacher in the secondary education. My career, that had been hard and quiet, has change definitely. The children, my students offer to me some enormous satisfactions. If I hadn't decide start a new job, I wouldn't have had the change to reach a new and grateful objectives.</p>\n<h3><strong>Rafael, Venezuela</strong></h3>\n<p>I'm an Industrial Engineer and all of my jobs have been related to the marketing field. Last year, I worked as an intern with Chrysler. I was chosen for a marketing position that I really wanted. It was all due to the fact that I'd worked previously as the marketing professor's assistant. It's very unusual for Industrial Engineers to work in this area because they usually prefer to work with manufacturing process. However, I'd seen my sister's experience in the marketing field and I felt as if I wanted to be a part of that world too. </p>\n<h3><strong>Manoel, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>I have worked since I was 18. I had worked as auto mechanic before I started to work as government employee, my current job. I think when I will be retired, it will be good if I start a new career. Maybe something like estate agent.</p>\n<h3>Peter</h3>\n<p>I had had a tough time when I quited my first job as a flight attendant. This job gave me a good salary compare to our country salary and at that time I didn't have any networking or contacts. I had to drop a grade. I had been a credit officer in a bank with unpaid leave before I worked as an accountant until now. At this moment, there are still a lot of challenges for my career but I think I chose a right road.</p>\n<h3>TJ Chen, Taiwan</h3>\n<p>I've started work since 2011, but I don't think it had any opportunities to be promoted or got a pay raise in my first company, so I decided to change my job and improve my English 2 years ago.</p>\n<p>I had studied English to take a exam, then I did a good grade for myself.</p>\n<p>After that, I completed my resume and applied some companies for a new job.</p>\n<p>I had got a few interviews, and entered a company I want.</p>\n<p>Now I still work for this job and learn English in many ways.</p>\n<h3>Yamelith</h3>\n<p>One day I was doing my regular job and I realized that I really needed a change in my life so that, I decided to sell my car and hand my notice.</p>\n<p>I had been working for a logistic company for four years as an Engineer and I did love my job but I wanted to live abroad and become more open-minded.</p>\n<p>Starting in a new Country is not easy but I've always thought that is much better to regret about the things you did instead of regretting about things you never did. Of course you need to be brave and determined to achieve your goals but it is worthy.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>Whether I like it or not, I will be forced to move into a new line of work because I have recently been made redundant. Before my compulsory redundancy, I had worked for more than 10 years in a company selling building material. Anyway, I am quite confident to add a new skill under my belt soon, as I am studying english very hard. I hope to take up a job involving my english language knowledge because I wouldn't like my effort to learn english to be wasted.</p>\n<h3>Jose Maria, Spain</h3>\n<p>I have considerable experience in changing career. To begin with, I had worked as a consultant for two years when I decided to take a period of unpaid leave and think about my professional future, because I was not enthusiastic about what I was doing.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am going in for a public competition in the Ministry of Treasury, so I have a long haul of hard study to achieve my aim. Before that, I had improved my command of English for six months through a highly regarded Academy, as well as an accounting course.</p>\n<p>So, I hope I will do what I really like in the prompt future. The experience has shown me that it is extremely essential to find the job which makes you happy, because you will be working most part of your life.</p>\n<h3>Antonio, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I am a civil servant since 2008, but before this I had worked for 30 years as a bank clerk. I was already retired when decided to do a test for the new job. Between the two events I'd tried a period as unpaid leave. But I hadn't money enough for this and then decided to make a test for a new job. This new job is quite financially rewarding.</p>\n<h3>Ewa, Poland</h3>\n<p>By the time I had worked as a employee I realised that I want work for myself. I had taken a period of unpaid leave and then I prepared myself to new line of work. I've had excellent skills of organisation and great eager to change my live therefore I was sure that I'll succeed. I've chosen the area of tourism because I live in town that is often visited by people from around the world. I knew I need to be gutsy and work very hard but I also knew that I would cope with it all.</p>\n<h3>Simret</h3>\n<p>Changing my career is one of the hardest thing that I’ve ever done in my life. I was a second year medical student when I decided that being a doctor is not the line of work I want to pursue. I hadn't studied hard, so I failed my exams.</p>\n<p>That is when I decided to move sideways and pursue my interest in technology. I’ve dropped out of medical school and joined a college to study computer science. What I like about this field is that it is always changing and there is always a new thing to learn.</p>\n<h3>Eleonora, Italy</h3>\n<p>Elena is my sister, she is 36 year-old and she was a shop assistant in a little ladieswear boutique. She was quite happy doing this job, but one day she met an association committed to wild animals protection, so she began as a volunteer to care of wounded animals and then when she realized that she was happy there. She left her job and started a new adventure, first as a volunteer and now she is working as clerk in administration, but it might be she will take a veterinarian degree and she’ll work as veterinarian there.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>My first work was in a beer factory, when I started there, I hadn't known the process to make beer. I learned much about this industry but I realized that my line of work in that job I didn't like more. For this reason, I started to study electronic engineering and now I'm working as support engineer in other company, and I think that I have the conviction and the instincts to make a good job there but I need to study english because I want to move in that job at a high level.</p>\n<h3>Anh Le</h3>\n<p>I graduated from high school when I was age 18. I had decided to learn sewing and worked as tailor since then. One day I realized that I wanted to change my life. I decided to take part the courses in English Center. Through the advice of friend, I took the examination entry to Scientific, Social and Humanity University in English. I had studied very hard and graduated from University in 2000. I had started to work as officer then. Although the current job doesn’t give more money than the others, I really love it. It makes me happy. That’s all.</p>\n<h3>Connie</h3>\n<p>I had learnt a lot from my father before I tried to find out what would be my second career. At first, he had a driving licence for private car. Later, he got two driving licences for lorry and mini van. Simultaneously, he found a job of lorry driver. The reason why he got a driving licence for mini bus was that the government would offer you a driving licence provided that you intended to join that industry. After he had retired, he felt bored and he still got a job of mini van driver. He always reminded me that once you had learnt some skills and knowledge even though it can't help you to earn a living at that moment but it may be useful after a decade. Those skills and knowledge were definately your asset in your life.</p>\n<h3>Ardeshir, Iran</h3>\n<p>I had graduated in physics before I started to learn English . In this country there is not a good job for students of physics. I had worked as a radiation protection supervisor with a bachelor degree before I started my master course. I was actually excelled at physics. unfortunately I could not get my PH.D degree because of my bad luck.3years ago my job was ended,because of the catastrophic conditions in my country. I had not gotten a job and there was no line of work for me so I decided drop a lower grade as a teacher. I had been an unemployed person before I started to teach physics with a low earnings. My bad situation caused to my divorce. Anyway I have invited to a job interview .I must be gutsy to get the job and so on make my world again. But if they do not hire me , I will go to the business world with the rest of my life. I have trust to my instincts.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Angel, Spain</h3>\n<p>The first thing I'd like you to know is comprised in next statement: My illness. Multiple sclerosis, changed my life a lot, at least with reference to work. Acordingly to public institution which control the work Spaniards do, I can't make my job here in Spain as I'd like to.</p>\n<p>So I study English and forex trading everyday to try to enlarge the money which I earn home to maintain home, my wife and two sons, and the pension for the third one.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about what activity was more self rewarding. Studying English, teaching economy or writting some economy articles related wth the time being, would be my preferred activities nowadays.</p>\n<p>Money is not a driver subject right now. I've never had any problem with my wage, or the money I've been paid. Money isn't all what life is about. You have to look something more, being trusted for example.</p>\n<h3>Sam Lo, Taiwan</h3>\n<p>Last year, I planned to apply a summer internship of bank before I entered the graduate school of economics, but I was rejected. In order not to waste my summer vacation time, I made a different decision. I had been a waiter of the Italian restaurant before I started my graduate school life. That was special experience, and I hadn’t known so many things about waiters and restaurants before I started to be a waiter. Although I had quit when I started my graduate school life, I often go to the restaurant to take dinner and meet my ex-colleague.</p>\n<h3>Francois</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of my career, and although I graduated in a Business School, I got through evening courses to improve my skills in banking. So, by the time I applied for a managing position, I had already improved my ability to apply and prove I was the suitable person. And when I got the position, I had already got the skills which made me at ease. I think it's the right way: if you have career goals (which aren't only wishes) you need to prove you really long for reaching them and that you are able to fill the position on offer.</p>\n<h3>Agata, Italy</h3>\n<p>In Italy, in the past, my grandfather received a financial reward and a gold medal at the end of his career, because he had worked for fifty years in the same company.</p>\n<p>Fifty years ago people hadn't matured a period of volunteer, internship or networking like today. Workers had matured credibility, strong human relationship with colleagues and bosses, today some colleagues or bosses are like meteors.</p>\n<p>Everything can change only in one years. If someone thinks to move in another company, after 20 years in the same company, he will be seen as lazy with experienced less!</p>\n<h3>Yu Hui</h3>\n<p>Before I started to pursue my dream career in law, I had worked as a nurse.</p>\n<p>It is never easy to have even an inch of progress in the new career. I had done a part-time law degree before I entered the new career. I worked as a nurse as my full-time job.</p>\n<p>I needed to request for paid or unpaid-leave for examination. That was a daunting experience because, whenever I did it, there were colleagues and seniors asking me to be focused on nursing only, and law was not an option opened for me. However, their discouragement became the booster for my legal study.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I finished my law degree and I will start my job in a law firm very soon.</p>\n<h3>Camilo Arturo</h3>\n<p>When I finished my Master, I didn't want to continue my pHd degree in the same area, so I decided to stop and think, I had stopped during 6 months and I started my pHd in other area more interesting for me.for me.</p>\n<p>I had been studying things that I didn't enjoy, I had to stop and I really make something that I enjoyed a lot.</p>\n<p>I love my research and I want to make things that helps our society. I had needed a moment of my life to stop and thought that I actually wanted to do</p>\n<h3>Araki, Japan</h3>\n<p>I was forced to move into a new line of work because the company I had worked for was about to be closed down. I had been eager and trying to get the company revitalized until the top management decided to give it up. Fortunately, I got offers from several companies then and set mind to join one of them. As I expected, it was hard to adapt myself to new surroundings. Yet, I could keep myself gusty by remembering the word from my friend, \"No setback would be given to the person who is not able to overcome it.\"</p>\n<h3>Francesca, Italy</h3>\n<p>I have a friend named Marco who made a particular choice in his life when he was about 30 years old.</p>\n<p>Everyday he went to a garage, where he was a mechanic; he loved his work, but he felt he could do more. In the evening, when he came home, he always played flute, his preferred instrument that he had studied before he was hired as a mechanic.</p>\n<p>He thought how he could use this passion to help other people, so, in the following period, he decided to make the transition: he followed his instincts and dreams and he call some musician friends to form a band. They began to rehearse together and they were very gutsy to spread music among young and old people during concerts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Marco and his friends became volunteers at the hospital of their town and they still keep sick children company with their beneficial music.</p>\n<h3>Serena</h3>\n<p>Life is not easy for new emigration – no contacts and no networks. I had served as a Marketing Director at China before I moved to Australia. Since I have excellent experience under my belt, I got a job offer as Indent Account Manager in an Importing Company. I had to drop a grade to be in this new work environment. Soon I realized that being full-time-job mum with a six-years-old daughter is challenge, both physical and mental. Before moved to Brisbane, I had studied Aged Care and completed my internship in Melbourne. I am excelled at interpersonal skill and love to chart with elders. I took up the role of AIN at Blue Care after I had moved to Brisbane. It is only two-kilometer distance from my home to work place. The job meets my current needs although I have dropped two grades. I only work four shifts a fortnight, which means I spend more times with my family and plan future career.</p>\n<h3>Rolando, Argentina</h3>\n<p>I am an agricultural engeneer who worked as an assistant professor at</p>\n<p>Univeristy for 15 years. By the time I got my position I had worked as</p>\n<p>a volunteer teacher for 5 years. In 2013 I decided to move to Mar del</p>\n<p>Plata, 400 km south BA so I quit my job. It was the most difficult</p>\n<p>decission I have ever made. Nowadays I have my own small seed company</p>\n<p>and I also work as a garden writer. These activities are not financial</p>\n<p>rewarding but living close to the sea has greatly improved my quality</p>\n<p>of life.</p>\n<h3>Tahnee, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I had worked with graphic production and similar activities for ten years before thinking to change the carrier. At the same time I teach marketing in a technical high school and I believe to keep with this for a long time still. I had studied very hard but I didn't realise that was so important to know more than two languages and other specific technology information knowledges to rise highest marketing positions. I want to direct my professional experience to develop new teaching methods and inspire the students to change their environment and keep the same into private organizations. It's quite difficult because we have a bad infrastructure in our schools. I must to be gutsy to do this.</p>\n<h3>Susana, Spain</h3>\n<p>I had studied hard through all my life. I really feel myself as an eager student, even now. I work as a civil servant since 1991 but it is an absolutely routine job. I took up one specific role inside the Administration and 24 years later…I remain at the same line of job.</p>\n<p>But I didn't stand with my arms crossed. During this time I had taken care of my three children and I also studied Law, several courses of specialization, two Masters and foreign languages… then, </p>\n<p>I think I have got a very important baggage under my belt, however not possible to change my job!!</p>\n<p>I would like to have the opportunity of enjoying an unpaid leave; I would be also willing to move down…I even consider myself gutsy… but three young under my responsibility... it’s not easy!!</p>\n<h3>Erdemerbey, Turkey </h3>\n<p>A few months ago when I arrived home my father hadn't finished his meal so we could make a few conversation and while I and my father talked about my working life he told me you could change your career. You don't have to work in a position that is relevant your graudation. </p>\n<p>It's interesting because thinking about changing career or work life or having a second chance make us more hopeful. İt make us feel better and say us \"yes you can\" but is it true ? İt's a fact that only a few person have real opportunity to change his or her life. </p>\n<p>I think it's a little nonrealistic idea. It's not only about us it's about society. Maybe we should start changing society not only each of us.</p>\n<h3>Patricio</h3>\n<p>I am accountant and in the beginning of my profesional career I started to work in Internal Audit area in a private consultant. I had worked two years in this area when I decided to change to another because I was really boring of this type of job. I moved to IT area to work in SAP consultancy, specifically in logistic module... </p>\n<p>Since four years ago I was hired by an importat company due to I had won a lot experience participating in an important projects.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am particpating an important projects taking a role as leader and I am very motivated in continuous in that direction.</p>\n<h3>Rita</h3>\n<p>I had worked for 6 years in telecommunication companies and also in an access control company. I left my last job due to health problems but i don´t want to think i won´t work any more.</p>\n<p>I teach english lessons to a boy at home but i have the conviction i will be able to improve my teaching ability by improving my own english level,  which is something one is improving all life long.</p>\n<p>I havent stopped  practising english in the last years, at least i have read lots of novels and i have had a go on writing some poems in English too.My favourite music bands and singers are English  and i like to  sing the lyrics while the CD player is working, The point is keeping my English alive and growing for a better future.</p>\n<h3>Svetlana</h3>\n<p>Some years ago I made a great decision for my carrier. I had got a position of the head of a department in a big company. I am a perfectionist, I did my best. I worked hard for three years to make my team better and able to do better work. Hard-working made me exhausted and finally I got that if I would work like this further I would get my health problem. And I refused to be a leader of one of the best department in the company. I chose my health and calmness instead power and money.</p>\n<h3>Raphael, Curitiba, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I've never changed my career but last year, I went to Dublin, Ireland to study English. </p>\n<p>I thought that when I come back to Brazil it would be easy to find a new Job. People here talk that English is very important for Technology companies.</p>\n<p>But it was difficulty to find a job, so I had to accept to earn less than I earn before.</p>\n<h3>Monize Miyada Vargas, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I have contact with some people who changed their careers. For example, my husband’s friend Fred is a doctor now, but he was an engineer student three years ago and he had left his career as an engineering and moved to medicine. At that time, I believe he had lived a hell, because his  parents disagreed about his decision and did not approve that. But, he was determined and today he is very happy with his new job. He is more complete and he does his job with love and compassion. And, believe me, his parents are very proud of him!  So, change your career maybe it can be a  good thing to  do, in the end you must be happy with yourself, this is the most important thing!</p>\n<h3>Pawan</h3>\n<p>Well, I'd say 'Study Change' rather than 'Career Change' in my own words. I had studied science before i decided to move on to the field of management. Science didn't interest me at all with those hefty formulas to go through; I'm rather enjoying finance and accounting. In addition, I'm preparing for internship and would also like to volunteer to gain the much needed working experience. So, now i feel my convictions will lead me to the path of success where I'm hopeful about excelling in my chosen field of study and career of-course.</p>\n<h3>Ília </h3>\n<p>Till now I've changed my career twice. At first time I afforded money to support me during two years, the time to study and get qualifications to move to a new line of work. Some years later I had made redundancy. The time I get unemployed give the free time needed to get more qualifications. But starting a new career means drop a grad or two with significant reduction on salary. So with some contacts and some experience I decided to manage towards the specialization in the current career. </p>\n<h3>Oni </h3>\n<p>In 2014, I graduated from my university and while waiting my graduation ceremony, I decided to be a teacher in a private school. My school’s condition was bad because all of the school aspects were poor. But, I thought it was an internship before leaving my university.</p>\n<p>However, after six months and I had done my graduation ceremony, I thought I needed to have a better job because at that time I lived independently. Consequently, I chose to leave my job and tried to find another line of work. I was confident because of my experiences under my belt. But, in reality, it didn’t run well. I was in unpaid leave for three months and I realized that contact and networking were very important.</p>\n<p>Then in the fourth month I got a new job but I had to drop a grade. I took up the role of a elementary school teacher, whereas I wanted to move sideways.</p>\n<h3>Nouf, Yemen</h3>\n<p>I have been working in the line of work for eight years. I had worked as a Secretary before this job, but I hadn’t an interest in being a Secretary.</p>\n<p>I want to change a bit, because I have been under the same title for eight years. I tried to be open-minded and improve myself and my qualifications, I am eager to learn. So, I completed my University degree in Law and I graduated. I am planning to move sideways with the help of my good contacts and some experience under my belt, and look for a better opportunity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session.

I'm Catherine…</br></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Neil, like your hat!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you very much. It's cold outside, so I thought it would be <strong>sensible </strong>to wear a woolly hat.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>My ears are very <strong>sensitive</strong> to the cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I've noticed your ears looking a little bit red of a morning, occasionally, Neil. And the words <strong>sensible</strong> and <strong>sensitive </strong>are good examples of today's topic. The two words look and sound similar, but they have very different meanings. And in this programme we're going to talk about more pairs of words that people sometimes get mixed up.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now let's now hear about Mike. He was in a shop yesterday when he made a mistake.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Think about this question while you listen: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>Mike felt <strong>bored</strong>. He was watching a <strong>boring</strong> film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know – I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'. The <strong>recipe</strong> looked easy – just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>. But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar. He went to the shop and bought some. The cake looked great. But it tasted horrible. Mike checked the <strong>receipt</strong>. He'd bought salt by mistake!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we asked you: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is: He bought salt instead of sugar.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, the <strong>receipt</strong> said 'salt' but the <strong>recipe, </strong>of course, said 'sugar'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The nouns <strong>receipt </strong>and <strong>recipe </strong>look very similar, but they have different meanings. A <strong>receipt</strong>, r – e – c – e – i – p – t, is a document that shows you have paid money for something.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and a <strong>recipe</strong>, r – e – c – i – p – e, is a set of cooking instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Listen to a clip from Mike's story. Can you spot two more confusing words?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>He was watching a boring film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know – I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that's<strong> desert</strong> and <strong>dessert</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yep. Now a <strong>desert </strong>is an area of land where very little can grow and there's very little water. <strong>Desert, </strong>d – e – s – e – r – t, has one 's', but <strong>dessert</strong>, d – e – s – s – e – r – t, has two 's'. A <strong>dessert</strong> is a sweet food course that we eat at the end of a meal. Right. Moving on. Neil, what do you do when you are <strong>bored</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I find making cakes <strong>boring</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. When I'm <strong>bored</strong>, I knit.  </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You knit?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Of course - the hat!

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>    <br/>In this programme we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>We'll tell you what they are and how they’re used.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>We'll give you some tips to help you understand the difference between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we'll also have a quiz to test your understanding.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>Right. Let's get started. Finn, can you tell us about adjectives first.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>OK. Certainly, let's start with a simple example. What am I holding up?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>    <br/>You've got two biscuits, Finn . One is <strong>plain </strong>and one is <strong>chocolate</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>Yes. Do you like both?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I do.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Me too. In that sentence there were two adjectives, <strong>plain </strong>and <strong>chocolate</strong>. What do those words do?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>Well, Finn. Those words describe the biscuits.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>That's right. Adjectives are describing words: they tell us about nouns. In this case they tell us about the biscuits. A <strong>plain </strong>biscuit. A <strong>chocolate </strong>biscuit.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>Fantastic. What else do adjectives describe?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>Lots of things. They can also describe pronouns. Listen out for the adjective <strong>happy</strong> in this example. Here's Neil</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>   <br/>The adjective <strong>happy</strong> - what did that refer to?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It referred to the pronoun <strong>he</strong>, which in this example was Peter.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, Peter was <strong>happy</strong>. He was <strong>happy</strong>. He was a <strong>happy</strong> Peter.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So adjectives are words that give us information or additional information about nouns. When it comes to adverbs there is a bit of a clue in the name, isn't there, Finn?Ad – verb, add information about a verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That is one thing that adverbs do. They give us information about verbs. They can tell us how someone does something or how something happens. Now, let's listen again to the example. As well as the adjective <strong>happy </strong>there's also an adverb in the sentence. What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peter played <strong>well</strong>. After the game he was <strong>happy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The adverb there was <strong>well</strong>. Peter played <strong>well</strong>. The word <strong>well</strong> isn't describing Peter himself: it's describing how he did what he did.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT          <br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We've seen that adjectives describe nouns and adverbs talk about verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You mentioned that referring to verbs was only one thing that adverbs do. So, where else can we use them?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Adverbs can also describe adjectives, and even other adverbs. Remember the biscuits?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>    <br/>I'm looking at them right now, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Look good, don’t they?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They do!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>What do you feel when you see the biscuits?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I feel hungry!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Is hungry an adjective or adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It is an adjective because it's describing me, my feeling – and I'm a noun!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You are a noun! And now if I ask you how hungry you are, what would you say?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well the chocolate biscuit in particular is making me feel <strong>very</strong> hungry.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> Very</strong> hungry. <strong>Very</strong>. Hungry. What is the word <strong>very </strong>referring to? Is it you, the noun?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>No, it's the adjective <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Exactly.<strong> Very </strong>is an adverb. So as well as adding information about verbs, adverbs can also tell us about adjectives. And they can even tell us about other adverbs. Let's hear our earlier example again please, Neil?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Remember that the word <strong>well</strong> is an adverb. But how <strong>well</strong> did Peter play?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peter played <strong>really</strong> <strong>well</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right. So here the word <strong>really </strong>is telling us about the adverb <strong>well</strong>. How <strong>well</strong>? <strong>Really</strong> <strong>well</strong>. <strong>Really </strong>is also an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So adverbs can tell us about verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And adjectives describe nouns and pronouns. And now, it's quiz time.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We are going to give you a word, and read a sentence which contains the word. You need to decide if the word we give you is an adjective or an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. So, here's the first one. The word is <strong>blue</strong> and here's the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>. The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, is <strong>blue</strong> an adjective or adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It’s an adjective. <strong>Blue</strong> is describing the noun sky. Now number two: it's actually the same sentence but this time, think about the word <strong>dark</strong>. Is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or an adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The sky is <strong>dark</strong> blue.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. So, is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>Dark</strong> here is an adverb. Now number three. This time there are three words to listen out for: <strong>delicious</strong>, <strong>very</strong> and <strong>slowly</strong> – are they adjectives or adverbs?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Catherine ate the <strong>delicious</strong> biscuit <strong>very</strong> <strong>slowly</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No, she didn't. She ate it very fast. But, did you get them? <strong>Delicious</strong> is an adjective. It describes the noun biscuit.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Slowly </strong>is an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And finally, <strong>very</strong> is also an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So that's our introduction to adjectives and adverbs</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>   <br/>There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for  soon more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong>Both</strong>  <br/>Bye.</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>A gentle reminder</h3>\n<p>You know about adjectives and adverbs, don't you?</p>\n<p>You know that adjectives describe nouns, and that adverbs give information about a verb…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adjectives</strong>: <em>Rufus has an <strong>expensive</strong> car. It has <strong>leather</strong> seats.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Adverbs</strong>: <em>He drives it very <strong>slowly</strong> and <strong>carefully</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there's more to adjectives and adverbs than that. In Activity 1 we're going to remind ourselves about the differences between these parts of speech. In Activity 2 we're looking at some <strong>irregular</strong> examples.</p>\n<h3>Adjectives – meaning and use</h3>\n<p>As we've said, adjectives tell us about nouns. They also tell us about pronouns like he, she and it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He's very <strong>unhappy</strong>.</em></li>\n<li><em>She's <strong>stunning</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"GrammarBank\">Adjectives – Form</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Most of them have no particular form, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Happy, sad, light, green, quick, busy, large</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Though some are made by adding a suffix to a noun or verb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Fun – <strong>funny</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Week<strong> - weekly</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Child – <strong>childlike</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Fool – <strong>foolish</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Care<strong> – careful</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Accept<strong> – acceptable</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adverbs – meaning and use</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">You know that adverbs tell us about verbs, but did you know they also tell us about adjectives and other adverbs?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>It was a <strong>very</strong> sunny day. </em>(The adverb <strong>very</strong> refers to the adjective <strong>sunny</strong>. It tells us how sunny it was.)</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>He finished the exam <strong>really</strong> <strong>quickly</strong>. </em>(The adverb <strong>really</strong> refers to the adverb <strong>quickly</strong>. It tells us how quickly he finished.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adverbs - form</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Many adverbs can be made by adding the suffix <strong>–ly</strong> to an adjective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Sad – <strong>sadly</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Serious<strong> – seriously</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Quiet<strong> – quietly</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Total<strong> – totally</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Careful<strong> - carefully</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Sleepy - <strong>sleepily</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Slow<strong> - slowly</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">But others have no regular structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Soon</strong>, <strong>well</strong>, <strong>never, quite</strong>, <strong>often, already, just</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Story</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Singapore is a <strong>very</strong> <strong>diverse</strong>, <strong>multicultural</strong> country. The biggest <strong>ethnic</strong> group is Chinese. They make up about 75% of the population. Other significant groups are the Malays and Indians. The country has four <strong>official</strong> languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, and most Singaporeans speak at least two of them <strong>fluently</strong>. In addition, a creole called Singlish is spoken <strong>widely</strong>, though this is <strong>officially</strong> discouraged by the government. The country has changed very <strong>fast</strong> in the last few decades as the economy has grown <strong>quickly</strong>. </span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Next</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Did you notice the word <strong>fast</strong> in that game? It can be both an adjective and an adverb. We look at a few irregular examples like this in the next activity.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Or hardly working?</h3>\n<p><span><span>So, are you <strong>working hard</strong> right now? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Whether you are or not, we have a question: what is the word <strong>hard</strong> in that sentence? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>It's an <strong>adverb</strong> – it gives more information about the way you are working. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But <strong>hard</strong> can also be adjective: <em>it's a <strong>hard</strong> job, that bed is <strong>hard</strong>.</em></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Hard is an example of a word which is both an adjective and an adverb. Other examples are:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span><span>Fast</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><span>Late</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><span>Early</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><span>High</span></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span>In that case, what does <strong>hardly</strong> mean? Actually, it's not connected to hard – it means <strong>barely</strong>, only a little. So if you're <strong>hardly working</strong>, you're not working very much at all!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Similarly, these are examples of adverbs which don't always mean what you think:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><strong>Lately</strong> (means <strong>recently</strong>: How have you been lately?)</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><strong>Highly</strong> (means <strong>favourably</strong>: His boss thinks highly of him)</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Note 1</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>After sense verbs like look, taste, smell, feel and sound, we often use the adjective form, as if it was an adverb:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em><span><span>That sounds bad / You look angry / She smells terrible / I feel awful</span></span></em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Note 2</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>Also, it's good to remember that not all words ending in –ly are adverbs. For example:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><span><span>That was a <strong>silly</strong> thing to do. (Adjective)</span></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><span><span>He was a <strong>bully</strong> at school. (Noun)</span></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><span><span>You have to <strong>apply</strong> for the job. (Verb)</span></span></div>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Let's do an exercise where you have to select the right word. It could either be an adverb or an adjective, regular or irregular.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done.

Not everyone has agreed they are art.</br></p>\n<p>(Top left, Flying Machine by Carsten Holler; top right, Self Portrait by Vincent Van Gogh; bottom left, some graffiti street art; bottom right, Fountain by Marcel Duchamp)</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Now you're going to read an article adapted from a video blog by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz. He recently visited an exhibition in London which displayed flying machines and slides. It made him ask himself: what is art?</p>\n<p><strong>Before you read</strong></p>\n<p>Look at these two summaries. Then read the article once, quite quickly, and decide which summary is correct.</p>\n<p>1. Will Gompertz thinks that not everything in an art gallery is really art.</p>\n<p>2. Will Gompertz thinks that if an object is in a gallery, it is art.</p>\n<h3>Is it Art?</h3>\n<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br/>In 1917, a French artist called Marcel Duchamp bought a <strong>urinal</strong>, laid it on its back, signed and entered it for an art exhibition. The committee were <strong>appalled</strong>, they thought it was <strong>disgusting</strong> and <strong>vulgar</strong>, and certainly not a work of art.</p>\n<p>But after Duchamp, the art world started to believe that anything an artist puts into a gallery <strong>automatically</strong> becomes a work of art. Can that be right?</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>An exhibition of the German artist Carsten Holler's work has opened at London's Hayward Gallery. It is full of <strong>playful</strong> <strong>installations</strong>, which the visitor is invited to <strong>interact</strong> with. These include a <strong>spiralling</strong> slide, a flying machine, two <strong>remote control</strong> beds, and <strong>goggles</strong> that turn the world upside down.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>But are his flying machines and spiralling slides works of art? If they were in a theme park I'm not sure that we would think so. At least Duchamp changed the context for his urinal – he didn't install it in a bathroom in a local art gallery. He stopped it from having any <strong>functional</strong> purpose at all – he put it in a gallery, laid it on its back, and called it a sculpture.</p>\n<p>He was asking us if art has to be beautiful and why it has to be made by an artist. The urinal sculpture became a way of delivering his message and so I think yes, it's an artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>But I'm not so sure that I'd call Carsten Holler's interactive installations artwork. They are fairground-type rides that happen to be in an art gallery. Their purpose and function hasn't changed at all and I reacted to them as if I was at a <strong>funfair</strong>. Maybe I'm missing some <strong>profound</strong> point but I <strong>just</strong> found them <strong>amusing</strong> - a distraction. They didn't <strong>move</strong> me like a great Picasso painting or indeed many works by Duchamp.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5</strong><br/>I'm not saying that Carsten Holler isn't an artist but just that not everything he says is art is <strong>necessarily</strong> art. And I think that applies to many other artists and their installations in galleries. It's time, I think, to question what is and what isn't art.</p>\n<p>This article was based on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33109199\" target=\"_self\">video blog </a>by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz.</p>\n<h3>Which was the correct summary?</h3>\n<p>The correct summary was:</p>\n<p>1. Will Gompertz thinks that not everything in an art gallery is really art.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge of adverbs and adjectives. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed that discussion about art and learned some interesting adjectives. In Session 4 Finn interviews artist Shan Pillay - the man who created the artwork for our drama, Alice in Wonderland!</p></div>",

I'm joined in the studio by the artist Shan Pillay who did the pictures for the Alice in Wonderland drama series. Hi Shan.</br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Hello there Finn.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>How's it going?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>It's going very well. Very well indeed.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Great. So before we go any further, lets listen to a clip from Alice in Wonderland.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>INSERT</strong><br/></span></span><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Alice found the March Hare and the Hatter, having a tea-party.</p>\n<p><strong>Hatter and March Hare<br/></strong>Would you like some tea? Tea, yes please! And cake? One cake, two cakes... One lump or two? Sugar?</p>\n<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Curiouser and curiouser. They're having a tea-party. But where are all the guests?</p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>So the tea party scene there. Lots of fun and noise and <strong>clinking</strong> of cups. And we have a wonderful picture of it Shan. Can you describe what's in the picture? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>It's a <strong>chaotic</strong> <strong>scene</strong>, drawn from Alice's <strong>point of view</strong>. So it's a <strong>lively</strong> <strong>image</strong>, it's done in a fun, <strong>cartoonish</strong> style with <strong>bold</strong> <strong>outlines</strong>. And along with the <strong>deranged</strong> Mad Hatter we have the <strong>equally</strong> mad March Hare. And both are dressed rather <strong>flamboyantly</strong>, don't you think?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Yes. So the Mad Hatter's wearing quite a <strong>garish</strong>, green top hat and a big bow tie. And the March Hare has got a pink bow tie and a <strong>purple</strong> suit jacket. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>And a <strong>ruffled</strong> shirt.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>That's great. A ruffled shirt, good.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>And of course the other character who's in here, sitting in the teapot, is the dormouse. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Ah, so tell me about the dormouse.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Well this character is quite <strong>sleepy</strong>. You can see he's <strong>sleepily</strong> sitting in the teapot. And this is shown in his <strong>droopy</strong> ears and <strong>half-closed</strong> eyes. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>That's right. His droopy ears – his ears are hanging down. And his half-closed eyes. He must be quite sleepy, but can he be sleepy with all this <strong>madness</strong> happening around him? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Yes, he looks quite <strong>alarmed</strong> that he's been woken up from a <strong>slumber</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>He does. Now let's look at the next picture, which is of the Cheshire Cat, which is… what are those colours? Indigo?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>A <strong>purplish-indigo</strong> and <strong>turquoise</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Purplish-indigo and turquoise, and yellow eyes and yellow teeth. So what's happening here?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Well this is the Cheshire cat and he's appeared in the tree above Alice. You can see the expression on his face, it's a slightly <strong>creepy</strong> smile that suggests a <strong>mischievous</strong> personality. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>There's something going on, you're not quite sure what he's thinking, are you? So tell me about the teeth. What's the idea with the teeth?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Well I love that I did the mouth from one end to the other, it goes right across his face like going from America to England.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>It's almost as big as his body.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>And it looked good, it looked creepy. But I experimented with some colours some more, and I discovered that this bright yellow, that matched the yes as well, just <strong>heightened</strong> the creepiness of the smile if you like.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>It does. It's already creepy and you've heightened it, you've made it even more creepy, you've heightened the creepiness, by making it yellow. That's fantastic. Thank you, thank you Shan very much for coming here and telling us about your pictures today.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Oh it's been a pleasure.</span></span></p> </div>",

They're from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-21/session-5\">Alice in Wonderland</a> drama. In the top one there are three characters, from left to right: the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse. In the bottom one we have Alice and the Cheshire Cat.</p>\n<p>How would you describe these images?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Look at the pictures and listen to the audio</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Now we're now going to listen to an interview with the artist who made these pictures. His name is Shan Pillay, and he uses lots of adjectives and adverbs when talking about the characters in his pictures, for example:</p>\n<p><strong>sleepy</strong> <br/>tired and wanting to sleep</p>\n<p><strong>flamboyantly</strong> <br/>brightly coloured, confidently</p>\n<p><strong>deranged</strong> <br/>mad</p>\n<p>Which words do you think he will use to describe which character?</p>\n<p>All the definitions are in the Session Vocabulary box.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to the interview and then answer the questions.

The one below is from Episode 8 of our drama Jamaica Inn. There are two characters: Mary on the left, and someone called Mrs Bassat on the right.</p>\n<p>In fewer than 100 words, can you describe it?</p>\n<p>If you like, you can talk about the four aspects of style, colour, atmosphere and character. Try to use lots of adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Daniela, Italy</h3>\n<p>In a peaceful place in a house that it similar to a library two women are worried about something that happened.</p>\n<p>The character on the left, sat on an ancient green armchair, wearing a long dress of indefinite colour - maybe light green or dirty white - looks very scared with her hands opened close to her skinny cheeks and her lips half opened in a suffering cry.</p>\n<p>The woman on the right, standing in her light violet long dress, directs her glance to her in a worried expression. Maybe something was happened and both they are scared.</p>\n<h3>Erika, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Mary looks terrified, she is sitting in the chair with an Alarmed expression like something really bad happened, Mrs Basssat is right by her side but standing up looking droopy about Mary's reaction.</p>\n<p>Both are them are surrounded by a very sad atmosphere, a library colorless, Mary is wearing a very old green dress, similarly is Mrs Bassat wearing a dress, however is a purple one and looks very old fashioned.</p>\n<p>The scene is very intrigued.</p>\n<h3><strong>Manoel, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>Sitting in a green chair, Mary is shocked about the news she have heard. Her aunt wearing a purplish dress, is looking at her but she doesn't know what to do. Mary thinks she must run away. But Mrs Bassat is a elderly woman and Mary is worried that her aunt does not have another place to go.</p>\n<h3>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>That is a realistic style painting with characters in a room and they are in different emotion. The main colours of the picture are dark, grey and cold that make the picture a little bit dreary.</p>\n<p>The characters are two women, one is standing, Mrs. Bassat, and the other is Mary who is sitting on a chair. Mary looks frightened. Her full-opened eyes and hanging up hands look like a person who is unwillingly witnessing a frightening scene. By contrast, Mrs. Bassat looks emotionless.</p>\n<p>The largest colour pieces of the picture are the walls, the floor and two book shelves, and the characters. The walls are dark ivory, the floor and the book shelves  are dark grey and the books are mainly dark brown and dark green. The characters are also painted palely.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the painting describes an alarming scene by using dark and cold colors and pale emotion of the main character, Mary.</p>\n<h3>Anderson</h3>\n<p>It is an uneasy scene. Mary and Mrs Bassat are in a room that appears to be a study painted with simple brown colour. Mary is wearing a turquoise night gown, sitting in an armchair and looks horrified, she might just have received some terrible news that came to her as a severe blow. Her hands are trying to cup her stricken face to calm herself down. Mrs Bassat is standing beside her, she is wearing a purplish dress and a slightly paler apron over the dress at the front, apparently she is deeply concerned about how Mary's reaction to the news.</p>\n<h3>Khalid, Yemen</h3>\n<p>The picture refer to a dramatic scene, and it shows an emergency situation in a serious atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Through the picture I can see two characters who are Mary and Mrs Bassat they might be relatives, because when I look at the room which they are in, I see poor features, so they can not afford a home-maid.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, the atmosphere is shocking, that appears on  Mary's face and her hands are up near to her face also, but when I look at Mrs Bassat's face I do not see shocking features, by contrast, I see sadness features, so I think she is who told Mary bad news.</p>\n<p>The family - if I consider them as a family - lived in the past time from now, considering the type of the clothes which they are wearing, they are old-fashion. They are poor people, so their room painted with simple brown colour which differs from light to dark and white colour,also there are some cracks below the window beside the door.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, they concern about knowledge that why they have a lot of books.</p>\n<h3><strong>Maria, </strong><strong>Brazil</strong><strong>​</strong></h3>\n<p>This is an indoor scene, showing two women who seem to be having a serious conversation.</p>\n<p>We can observe two book shelves and an open door on the back, the artist uses dark colors on scene, that makes us believe that something unpleasant is happening. </p>\n<p>The younger woman in white has a scared expression, her hands reach her face. The other woman in a lavender dress seems worried. Both wear long sleeves representing that it might be cold in there.</p>\n<h3>Vasyl, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>There are two characters in the dark purplish and turquoise and brown-coloured room. Mary, the young lady uncomfortably sitting on a chair, seems really scared. The woman staying nearby looks at Mary suspiciously. Both of them are dressed simply and modestly. Their attires look quite domestic. An atmosphere depicted on the image is rather taut.</p>\n<h3>Airin, Japan</h3>\n<p>This picture is drawn in a gloomy style. The lines are solid and the colours are all dull. </p>\n<p>Two women are in a room. One sits in an arm chair covering her face with her hands as if she is shocked by something really frightening. The other woman stands besides her, looking down the floor with a serious face. She may be searching a way to solve a critical problem. Both of them are in plain dresses without any flamboyant things.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of books in shelves along the wall. None of them look attractive because their covers are all either dark green or dark purple. The books probably have not read by anyone for long.</p>\n<p>We can sense serious, creepy, horrifying atmosphere in the room.</p>\n<h3>Tiziano, Verona, Italy</h3>\n<p>The picture is neither funny nor sunny. In fact through the window you can see a cloudy weather that gives you a bit of sadness.</p>\n<p>The colours aren't lively, they're dark and gloomy. The floor and the library are brown. The designer hasn't used bright colors. Consequently the atmosphere becomes melancholy and unhappy.</p>\n<p>Maria sits on a green chair that doesn't reflect much light, she seems upset and worried. Maria wears a light-green dress, typically used at the beginning of the 20th century. Instead the woman next to Maria wears a purple dress, she seems to be alarmed and powerless.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>That scene describes the point of view of the writer about how is one of rooms the Jamaica inn. The cartoon are not funny and its characters are quite sad. The atmosphere in that room is very lugubrious and the brown and purplish colors are correct to express the sadness and despair that Mary live that place.</p>\n<p>The room where are they is similar to a library and the window behind of Mary allows us to imagine a fog day in this town. </p>\n<h3>Alessandra</h3>\n<p>This picture tells us of a very sad and worried atmosphere. The drawing shows us an elegant room, maybe the library of a distinguished house, but the darkness all around and the expression of the two women portrayed in it make us feel how dramatic the moment must be! Sat on the chair Mary, in her pale green dress, looks terrified, frightened as someone who has just seen a ghost. Beside her, the older woman, Mrs. Bassat, in her light violet dress seems to be very worried about something... What has happened?</p>\n<h3>Pavel, Russia</h3>\n<p>This picture made in gloomy style. Despite of different colors, not dark at all, there are light yellow part of wall, bright colored dressed on the two women, in general the picture transmit negative associations. It particularly because the young girl, who sits in a chair, and looks really scary and frightened about something. And women opposite her not looks equally scary, but more thoughtful and moodily. That even makes the whole atmosphere more strange and mysterious.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Angel, Spain</h3>\n<p>It's an ordered room full it up with completly ordered bookshelves for decoration purposes and two main characters from the story we are dealing. First one Mary, poorly dressed like a servant; and Mrs. Basset, her aunt, flamboyantly dressed wearing an indigo dress. The main colour is brown trying to create the misterious tone of the scene.</p>\n<h3>Zosia, Poland</h3>\n<p>The picture is gloomy, colours like brown and dark-purple heightened a bleakness. A girl on the left, Mary, is sitting in an armchair. She has dark hair and is wearing a light-coloured dress. She looks frightened and worried. A woman on the right in bright-purple dress is Mrs Bassat. She is older than Mary. She is thoughtful, serious and sad. It seems like Mary has to make an important decision.</p>\n<h3>Ewa, Poland</h3>\n<p>The scene of Jamaica Inn is in the sharp, meaty drawing style. Only one colour - violet - is determined. It could be that the person who wear it is the most important one. The rest of colours are dun and dirty. Atmosphere of Mary's point of view seems frightening, heavy and uncertain. On the other hand Mrs Basset seems to be just a little concerned. She is deep in thought and looking for solutions. There is a kind of gloom in this picture...</p>\n<h3>Yamelith</h3>\n<p>The atmosphere of the room is dark and heavy as well as the weather that we can see through the window – a dull cloudy sky. The sorrowful of the scene kills any feeling of happiness.<br>Mary looks completely shocked and scared as if Mrs Bassat had told her some terrible news or secrets. Mary's appearance is even worse because she is in a pale filthy white dress and it shows the poverty and hard time that Mary is dealing with.<br/>Mrs Bassat face expression is quite stoical but her wrinkly skin tells us about her worries and unhappy life.</br></p>\n<h3>Clarice, Italy</h3>\n<p>In the image, I see a gothic style.<br/>Mrs Bassat has a lilac dress and Mary a grey dress. The wall is a clear yellow, but the floor and the bookcase are very dark.<br/>The atmosphere is very gloomy, the room is dark the light comes only from the room that is behind.<br/>Mary is worried and troubled. Mrs Bassat seems to think how to resolve the problem she seems absorbed.</p>\n<h3>NGUYỄN VĂN ĐẠT, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>There are two characters in this picture. Mary on the left, she’s using her hands to cover her face. She looks really shock. Her hair is not very neat, it’s wet. She’s wearing a white-ruffled dress. She’s been in a river or a stream and experienced a chaotic scene, I guess. Totally, She must be frightened of something.</p>\n<p>About Mrs. Bassat, She’s in a violet dress. Her hair is very neat and her mouth is hanging down. It makes me think of rich and mischievous woman. She’s concentrating what happened shown on Mary’s face.</p>\n<p>Everything is in a library.</p>\n<h3>Georges Noel</h3>\n<p>The room is in darkness. Mary is sitting in a green chair and seems really frightened. She ups her two hands as to shield her face or to shut her ears against an unpleasant noise or a scream or a loudly cry. Mrs Bassat, upright, looks at far and appears severe but strong, the left arm, hung up, hand closed, as to fight or perhaps to protect herself. She is wearing a purple dress. Her yellow hairs are like to increase their possible grey colour. This choice increases her old face. By the back door, appears the light old painting of the other room.</p>\n<h3>Anazilda</h3>\n<p>The whole scene is a little creepy.  The atmosphere is oppressive and scary.  Mary seems to be alarmed, she looks at something out of the scene as she was afraid of what she sees.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bassat is wearying a purple  dress, what makes her contrast with the rest of the cartoon, mainly green, yellow and brown. She seems to be an unpleasant woman, ruthless and cold-hearted.</p>\n<p>The room is a little dark, with heavy shelves, but bright sunlight comes from the window in the other room, behind the door.</p>\n<h3>Micol, Torino</h3>\n<p>The scene is dramatic: it's drawn by cartoonish style but it isn't cheerful, the colours are dark,the books on the bookshelves are brown and dark-green, there are shadows on the walls.</p>\n<p>A young woman is setting, she's crouched and her eyes are scared. She's wearing a white dress,she's looking at something which has scared her. Near the girl there is an old woman, she's wearing a long, purple dress and she has an apron over the dress, her hair is grey. She's looking at the youmg woman but she can't help her.</p>\n<h3>Manuel, Panamá</h3>\n<p>In a dark and sepia illuminated room, that look antique and sad, somethiing like a kind of library room, there are two persons, a sadly face old woman dressing a purple clothes and a apron, and a girl sitting in a old green chair,  with a sacared and worry attitud, maby alarmed for something.  The illustration was made with acrylic painting or made with adobe Photoshop software.</p>\n<h3>Rita, Spain</h3>\n<p>The drawing is quite realistic, showing a decoration and clothes which match perfectly the XIXth style.</p>\n<p>The colours used by the artist are fade, cold and with a lack of happiness.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is uncomfortable , with a point of fear. Makes one feel concerned about both women, especially Mary.</p>\n<p>Mary shows a terrible face, She is pale and looks really scared.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bassat seems to be upset and worried about Mary but her pose shows she is determined to help her and find a definiitive solution for Mary´s suffering.</p>\n<p>The furniture, the books and the room tidines lead me to think that they are not in Jamaica Inn, they might very likely be at Mrs. Bassat´s.</p>\n<h3>Thomas</h3>\n<p>In this scene two women are staying in a paneled room of an old mansion. On the left Mary is sitting on a green cushioned chair her face lined with stress and her eyes looking creepy. Right next to her Mrs Basset ist standing in a ruffled purplish-indigo colored apron looking rather droopy.</p>\n<h3>Ammår</h3>\n<p>this is bad atmosphere at all , Mary is scared and set in old chair and spot on her ante , Mrs Basssat in right of picture she still stand up and looks tired , there is old books library . </p>\n<p>the weather out side this room looks cloudy and rainy </p>\n<h3>Pawan</h3>\n<p>It's a melancholic scene, with Mary looking appalled and Mrs.Bassat deeply concerned, they portray an alarming event. Marry, with those ruffled dress, greenish in color, look dreadful. She must have heard some horrid news from Mrs. Bassat who doesn't seem as horrified as she is. Mrs. Bassat's gloomy face, with blonde hair, also indicates some sinister happening. Furthermore, the old-fashioned furniture, rugged clothes, rather dark room adds dreariness to the scene.  </p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>This picture shows two persons in a room which gives some sad feelings, owing to the fact that colours are not very flamboyant. On the left, Mary seems quite frightened, and on the right Mrs Bassad has a vacant look and appears very confused. The clothes they are wearing are pleated and suggest that they have been enduring tough circumstances. So the atmoshpere is very tense, oppressive as if something went or will go amiss.</p>\n<h3>Ília</h3>\n<p>Mary appears very frightened sat down on a chair with her hands raised in front of her paled face and Mrs Bassat stands up with a worried expression as something bad had happened. The women are in a library full of books in a heavy atmosphere even colours <br/> without blow expresses sadness. Both are wearing ruffled garments which underlines the scenario of mistery. <br/> The room and the way characters are dressed take us to a country style on XIX century.</p>\n<h3>Mohammad Al Afifi, Palestine</h3>\n<p>In an upset scene Mary is  emotionally chocked setting on an old chair, Mrs. Bassat is standing near Mary and looking at her sadly, Both of them are wearing old fashioned clothes with pale colors. The room is surrounded with green, purple and brown books, It looks like a small library, Room's door is open into corridor with glass window.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is really full of fear and anxiety.</p>\n<h3>Swam, Myanmar</h3>\n<p> This picture is a classic, dull and a vividly coloured image at a library.Mary is wearing  sand-like clothes while Mrs Bassat is wearing a pale purplish dress. It seems like a distressing situation as Mary seems tearful. She probably wants to tell Mrs Bassat about her terrible experiences she had on the ship. Mary looks tearful while Mrs Bassat seems a bit tense.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is an interesting image.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and me Catherine. And in this programme we're talking about the letters <strong>o-u-g-h. </strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, the letters <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>are found in lots of English words including <strong>cough</strong>,<strong> rough</strong>,<strong> ought </strong>and<strong> through</strong>, but there are lots of different pronunciations. So let's start with George. He's talking about last winter, when he was ill.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And think about this question while you listen: What did George do in February?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/> George<br/></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months. By February, I <strong>thought </strong>I <strong>ought</strong> to go to the doctor. He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check and some medicine. It got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the <strong>cough</strong> lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April. I'm so glad spring's here!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Poor George. And we asked: what did George do in February?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, George <strong>thought</strong> that he <strong>ought </strong>to go to the doctor. So that's what he did.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Good. Now the words <strong>thought</strong>, spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h-t </strong>and <strong>ought</strong>, spelt <strong>o-u-g-h-t,</strong> both have the <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>pattern in them and it's pronounced <strong>or</strong>. <strong>Thought, ought</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Thought,<strong> ought</strong>.<strong> </strong>And there are more <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> verbs with the same pronunciation, like <strong>fought</strong>, the past of <strong>fight</strong>, and <strong>bought</strong>, the past of <strong>buy</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...and <strong>brought</strong>,<strong> b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>, the past of <strong>bring</strong>. People sometimes confuse <strong>bought </strong>and <strong>brought</strong> so Catherine, can you give us an example sentence with both words?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I <strong>bought</strong> a new TV from the hypermarket and I <strong>brought</strong> it home in a taxi.</p>\n<p>Now let's have another clip. And how <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>words are there in this one?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>George<br/></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So there were two <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> words there: <strong>Cough</strong>:<strong> c-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>roughly</strong>:<strong> r-o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>. <strong>Roughly</strong> means <strong>about</strong>, so George had a <strong>cough</strong> for about - or <strong>roughly</strong> - three months.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But the pronunciation of these two words is different. The <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> cough</strong> sounds like <strong>off</strong>.<strong> Off</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> roughly</strong> sounds like <strong>uff</strong>.<strong> Uff</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. So we're beginning to see that there is no real rule for pronouncing these words, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Sadly not, that's right. You are just going to have to learn to spell and say each word on its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>George<br/></strong>He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the<strong> o-u-g-h </strong>word there was <strong>thorough</strong>:<strong> t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h</strong>. It means <strong>very careful and exact</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the pronunciation is different again. Listen to this one: <strong>thorough</strong>. It's an <strong>uh </strong>sound at the end of the word.<strong> Uh</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>, <strong>uh</strong>,<strong> thorough.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Here's one more clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>George<br/></strong>I got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the cough lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>This time we heard <strong>although</strong> spelt<strong> a-l-t-h-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>through, </strong>spelt<strong> t-h-r-o-u-g-h</strong>.  Now the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in <strong>although, </strong>sounds like <strong>oh</strong>.<strong> Although</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And in<strong> through</strong>, it sounds like <strong>ooo</strong>. <strong>Through</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So you know what, that gives us six different pronunciations for the letters <strong>o-u-g-h</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, six of them. We had: <strong>thought</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>,<strong> although </strong>and <strong>through</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So in fact there are more than six pronunciations for <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in the English language, but these are the most common ones.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And now it's time for the quiz! OK, question number one: How do you spell <strong>brought</strong>, the past simple of the verb <strong>bring</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's <strong>b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> Very good. Number two: How do you pronounce the word that is spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's <strong>though</strong>. <strong>Though</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> That's the one. Number three: <strong>Roughly</strong> and <strong>enough</strong> have similar spelling and pronunciation. How do you spell <strong>roughly</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's <strong>r</strong>-<strong>o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done if you got all those right. Now before we go, here's our vocabulary tip. If your phone or computer lets you record audio, try recording the spelling and pronunciation of tricky words so you can play them back if you need help to remember them.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And me, Catherine. Hello.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>And today, we’re talking about the third conditional. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes - we’ll be looking at why and when we use it.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And we’ll see how to form it…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>There’ll be at a very helpful pronunciation tip…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>And there’ll also be a third conditional quiz at the end of the show!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, the main use of the third conditional is to talk about imaginary situations in the past. And here’s Mike with our first example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>I was really late for work today. When I got to the station, it turned out the trains were cancelled. <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And Mike’s last sentence is describing an imaginary situation. In reality, Mike was late for work because he didn’t know the trains were cancelled, and he didn’t take a bus. He uses the third conditional to imagine a different past situation when he says: <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Let’s take a closer look. There are two parts to this sentence. One part is made with <strong>if </strong>plus <strong>past perfect</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span><strong>If I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the other part is made of <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>would have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>… <strong>I</strong> <strong>would have taken</strong> a bus.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And we put the two parts together to talk about an imaginary situation in the past, and its </span><span>imaginary result. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You can change the order of the two parts if you like: the meaning stays the same:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span><strong>I would have taken</strong> a bus <strong>if I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have some more examples. Listen out for <strong>if</strong> plus <strong>past perfect</strong> with <strong>would </strong></span><span><strong>have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>I got two Ds and an F in my exams. <strong>If I had worked harder, I would have got better </strong></span><strong><span>grades.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Patty was a great singer when she was younger. <strong>She would have won that TV talent show if she had entered it.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we can use negatives in either or both parts of the sentence. Here are a couple of examples, with the negative forms <strong>hadn’t</strong> and <strong>wouldn’t</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>Abid met his wife at university. They’ve been married for 3 years now.<strong> If Abid hadn’t gone to university, he wouldn’t have met his wife. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span>I registered my mobile phone on a tracker website. When I lost it, I logged on to the site and they told me where it was.<strong> If I hadn’t registered my phone, it would have been lost for ever.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>So you can see that the third conditional is very useful to talk about things we’re pleased we did, as well as things we wish we’d done differently. So what about you Neil – anything you’d change – or not change – in your past?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>I lived in Canada when I was a child and if I hadn’t lived in Canada I wouldn’t have got dual citizenship. I’m a citizen of the UK and Canada. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And we’re talking about third conditionals. And now it’s time to talk about pronunciation. We use lots of short forms in third conditionals. And here’s Mike again with an example. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>If <strong>I’d</strong> had my camera, <strong>I’d</strong> have taken a photo. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>So in the <strong>if</strong> part, <strong>I</strong> and <strong>had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I’d.</strong> In the main part, <strong>I </strong>and <strong>would</strong> are </span><span>shortened to <strong>I’d</strong>, and we also drop the <strong>h</strong> from have. So <strong>I would have</strong> becomes <strong>‘I’d’ve’. </strong>Let’s hear another example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><strong><span>If I’d woken up earlier, I wouldn’t have missed my flight.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>So <strong>I had</strong>  become <strong>I’d</strong> in the if part and <strong>would not have</strong> becomes <strong>‘wouldn’t’ve’</strong> in the </span><span>main part. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Now it’s time for a quiz! I’m going to say two sentences, and you have to use them to make a third conditional sentence. Here’s the first one. Mike forgot Jane’s birthday. She was upset.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>If Mike hadn’t forgotten Jane’s birthday, she wouldn’t have been upset. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Good. Another one: I ate too much. I feel sick.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>If I hadn’t eaten too much, I wouldn’t have felt sick.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>And the last one: I didn’t go to the party. I didn’t meet Francesca.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I would’ve met Francesca if I’d gone to the party.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Exactly. And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. And we’ve just got time for a top tip before we finish. Remember, in standard English, there’s only one <strong>would</strong> in a third conditional sentence. We don’t use <strong>would</strong> in the <strong>if</strong> part. Here’s an example of an incorrect sentence.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>If Tom would have said sorry, Sonia would have forgiven him.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Here’s the correct version:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><strong><span>If Tom had said sorry, Sonia would have forgiven him.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Great. So that’s the third conditional. It’s made of <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>past perfect</strong> tense, and <strong>would</strong> <strong>have</strong> plus the past participle. We use it to talk about imaginary situations in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>There’s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.  Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Both<br/></strong></span><span>Bye.</span></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Imagined past events</span></span></h3>\n<p><em><span><span>If I'd won the lottery, I'd have moved to a beautiful Mediterranean island.</span></span></em></p>\n<p><span><span>But you didn't win. So you're still in the same place. As you can see, in the sentence above, we're talking about something that didn't happen. It only happens in your imagination. It's an imagined past event. And it's in the third conditional.</span></span></p>\n<p><span></span>We're going to do two activities. The first will test you on the meaning of third conditional.

Did it happen in real life? No, because it could only happen if the <strong>if</strong> part happened.</p>\n<p>We make the third conditional with <strong>if + past perfect</strong>, and <strong>would</strong> <strong>have</strong> <strong>+ past participle</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’d known</strong> it was your birthday … (This is the imaginary situation in the past.) <strong>I’d have bought</strong> you a present. (This is the imaginary result of the situation in the past.)</p>\n<p>But look at this:</p>\n<p><em>If I'd known Marta was ill, I would have gone to see her.</em></p>\n<p>In this one, was Marta ill? Yes, she was. But the speaker didn't know that. The <strong>if part</strong> talks about <em>knowing</em> Marta was ill, not about whether Marta was ill or not.</p>\n<p>The two parts can come in any order. When we write, we put a comma between the <strong>if</strong> part and the <strong>main</strong> part. You don’t use a comma when the <strong>main</strong> part comes first.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Before we look at form in more detail, let's do an activity to test your understanding of third conditional sentences.

A project can be many things from producing a language course to building a bridge. Read our guide and learn five basic <strong>principles</strong> of project management.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Now you're going to read a five-point guide to project management.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you read</strong></p>\n<p>Look at these two summaries. Then read the article once, quite quickly, and decide which summary is correct.</p>\n<p>1. Good project management is about creating a plan and making sure it doesn't change.</p>\n<p>2. Good project management is about making a plan and changing it if it's not working.</p>\n<h3>The principles of project management</h3>\n<p><span>1. <strong>A good development phase is important</strong>.<br>This is when people involved in the project decide the <strong>objectives</strong>: what it aims to achieve and within what time. They calculate costs and if they do this carefully, the better the chance of success. In some cases, if they hadn't noticed the need for extra <strong>funding</strong> at this early stage, the projects would have failed.</br></span></p>\n<p><span>2. <strong>Roles and goals</strong> <strong>must be clear and realistic</strong>.<br/>The project manager is responsible for the achievement of the objectives, and a <strong>kick-off </strong>meeting with the project team helps everyone to understand their <strong>roles</strong>. Further meetings take place to discuss individual workers' goals and these goals should be realistic. There are many examples of projects where they were not and problems arose as a result. </span>If the project manager had considered the team members' goals more carefully, they could have avoided many problems.</p>\n<p><span></span><span>3. <strong>The schedule and risks must be managed efficiently</strong>.<br/>The project manager produces the schedule and uses it to check that the team have completed tasks on time. <strong>Higher</strong> <strong>management</strong> will need reports at regular meetings, where they consider any risks to the project in terms of funding, time or staff. They make <strong>key</strong> decisions at these meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span>4. <strong>Have good communication within the team</strong>.<br/>There are many examples of projects on which the staff would have felt more <strong>motivated</strong> if there had been more communication. For project managers, good <strong>social skills </strong>and regular contact with the team are essential to make sure that everyone remains involved and informed.</span></p>\n<p><span>5. <strong>Be ready to adapt</strong>.</span><strong><br/></strong><span>Projects rarely go exactly as expected. Good project management requires the ability to deal with new challenges as a project develops.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Which was the correct summary?</h3>\n<p>The correct summary was:</p>\n<p>2. Good project management is about making a plan and changing it if it's not working.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge the <strong>third conditional</strong>. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>We hope you now understand more about project management.

Today we're talking about false friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But false friends aren't people! False friends are words that look or sound the same in two different languages - but have different meanings in each language.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right and today we'll give you plenty of examples...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...there will be a quiz of course...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and we'll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But first, here's Jim. He works as a student advisor, and he's talking about students' problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While you're listening to Jim, try to guess what the student called Camilla's problem really was.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jim<br/></strong>Lots of students come to me with their problems, but sometimes I have to guess what they mean! Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was busy in the <strong>kitchen</strong>. Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face. Camilla, from Spain, didn't know what to do because she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>. And when I helped Pierre, he said \"Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, did you guess what Camilla's problem really was?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is Camilla was actually <strong>pregnant</strong>! But she used the wrong word when she said she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She did. Because <strong>embarrassed</strong> is a false friend in Spanish and English. The Spanish word <strong>embarazada</strong> means <strong>pregnant</strong>. Apologies for my Spanish pronunciation there! Spanish speaking people need to be very careful before they tell someone they are <strong>embarrassed - </strong>or that their husband is! Listen out for more false friends in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jim<br/></strong>Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was in the<strong> kitchen</strong>. Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So I'm guessing that Claus didn't really want a <strong>rat</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I don't think so, I think he wanted some <strong>advice</strong> from Jim. The German word <strong>r</strong><strong>at</strong> means <strong>advice</strong> in English. And Claus was worried because his father was in <strong>prison</strong>. The word <strong>kitchen</strong> can mean <strong>prison</strong> in German.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Confusing. And what about Simone, who said she had <strong>buttons</strong> on her face...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Indeed. In French, the word <strong>boutons</strong> means <strong>spots</strong>. So, Simone thought that the English word buttons had the same meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now, let's have another clip. Pierre also said something quite strange.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Jim<br/></strong>And when I helped Pierre, he said \"Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So do you think that Jim was upset when Pierre said that? After all, Jim was trying to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, Pierre didn't mean to be rude. But in French <strong>terrible </strong>- like terrible - can have two meanings. It can mean <strong>very bad</strong>, but it can also mean <strong>great</strong>. It depends on the sound of your voice when you say it. Pierre meant that Jim's advice was <strong>great, </strong>not <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Wow, big misunderstanding. So the message is: don't get upset if someone from another country says something that seems a bit strange or perhaps rude. They might just be using a word that's a false friend.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Exactly. And be very careful yourself when you're speaking in another language. You know, there was this one time, I was in a hotel in France and I asked for a <strong>cushion</strong> - I thought that meant a cushion - for my bed. But it sounded like the French word <strong>cochon</strong> which means <strong>pig</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So you asked for a pig for your bedroom!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Today, we're going to play a guessing game. So number one: If a French man is holding some £10 notes in his hand but he says that he's got no money, what does he mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The answer is that he means he's got no coins. Yes, <strong>monnaie</strong> in French means <strong>coins</strong> or <strong>change.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very good. And number two: If a German woman in an English restaurant says that she wants to <strong>become</strong> a steak, is she joking - or does she really want to turn into a meal?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Well, the answer is neither.<strong> Bekommen </strong>in German is a false friend for<strong> become </strong>in English<strong>. </strong>She means that she wants to get a steak to eat.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right then. Number three: If someone from the US invites you to a party, Finn, and tells you to wear <strong>pants</strong>, should you be shocked?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, actually, no, you shouldn't. <strong>Pants</strong> in American English means <strong>trousers</strong>. It doesn't mean <strong>underwear</strong> like in British English!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's a relief! And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Keep a note of false friends between your language and English. You could use word cards, with the word on one side and the information with example sentences on the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And there's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

I'm <strong>embarrassed</strong>.\" What did she mean - and why did no-one give her a seat? Catherine and Finn talk about 'false friends' in 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-10/downloads\">Unit 10 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/6min_vocab\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3>\n<p>False friends are words that look the same in two languages but have different meanings. Some examples of false friends with English words are:</p>\n<p><strong>embarazada</strong> - embarrassed<br/>Embarazada means <strong>pregnant</strong> in Spanish</p>\n<p><strong>rat</strong> - rat<br/>Rat means <strong>advice</strong> in German.</p>\n<p><strong>boutons</strong> - buttons<br/>Boutons means <strong>spots on your face</strong> in French.</p>\n<p><strong>terrible</strong> - terrible<br/>Terrible can mean <strong>very bad</strong> or <strong>very good</strong> in French.</p>\n<p><strong>monnaie</strong> - money<br/>Monnaie means <strong>coins</strong> or <strong>change</strong> in French.</p>\n<p><strong>bekommen</strong> - become<br/>Bekommen means <strong>to get or have something</strong> in German.</p>\n<p><strong>pants</strong> - pants<br/>Pants means <strong>trousers</strong> in American English.</p>\n<p>When you are learning a language, it's easy to make a mistake by using a false friend. So don't be surprised if people from other countries do this.</p>\n<p>Take time to learn false friends between your language and English so that you don't say strange or rude things by mistake.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Loanwords</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>The English language borrows a lot of words from other languages.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Words like <strong>sushi</strong> from Japanese, <strong>ballet</strong> from French and <strong>vodka</strong> from Russian are all widely used by English speakers today. These words are called <strong>loanwords</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>There are probably loanwords in English which come from your language. If you look them up, it's a good way to build your English vocabulary quickly, as you already know the words!</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Cognates</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Another way to build your vocabulary is to learn <strong>cognates</strong>. These are words in different languages which have a similar form and meaning, because they all come from the same source.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>For example, the German word <strong>Brot</strong>, Dutch <strong>brood</strong> and English <strong>bread</strong> all come from the same early Germanic language. They don't have exactly the same spelling, but you can see the relationship. Another example is the word <strong>father</strong> in English, which in German is <strong>Vater</strong> and Latin is <strong>pater</strong>. It's thought that they all come from a very early language, which researchers call <strong>Proto-Indo-European</strong>.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>False friends</h3>\n<p><span><span>But be careful, there is another group of words which is more difficult. Loanwords and cognates are your friends when learning a foreign language, but there are also <strong>false friends</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Have a look at these examples:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The Spanish word <strong>embarazada</strong> looks like <strong>embarrassed</strong> in English. But they're false friends, because <strong>embarazada</strong> means pregnant! </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The French word <strong>librairie</strong> looks very similar to the English <strong>library</strong>. And they are both related to books. But while in English a library is where you go to borrow books – a <strong>librarie</strong> is where you go to buy them – it's a bookshop.</span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First we're going to do an activity to learn some <strong>loanwords</strong>. Can you work out what the words mean - and which language they come from?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next, we have some questions about false friends. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>It looks familiar, but…</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Now let's look at some false friends. <strong>Fattoria</strong> is a word in Italian. But what do you think it means in English? Here's a clue: it means either <strong>factory</strong> or <strong>farm</strong>... but which one?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>If you said <strong>farm,</strong> well done! Although <strong>fattoria</strong> looks like the word <strong>factory</strong>, it actually means <strong>farm</strong>. It's a <strong>false friend</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Now, to help you start exploring this aspect of language learning, let's do an activity to see if you can spot some other false friends. Read the six example sentences. Some of the words in bold are <strong>loanwords</strong> which are used correctly, some are <strong>false friends</strong> which are used incorrectly. </span></span><span><span>Can you spot which are which? Drag the words into the correct columns.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span>Example sentences</span></h3>\n<p><span>1) There was a huge student <strong>manifestation</strong> against rising fees at the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span>2) Marc would find the horror film too scary. He's very a <strong>sensible</strong> person.</span></p>\n<p><span>3) Can I borrow your <strong>handy?</strong> Mine is out of battery.</span></p>\n<p>4) Frank sleeps in green <strong>pyjamas.</strong></p>\n<p><span>5) Boris wore his most formal <strong>costume</strong> to the interview.</span></p>\n<p><span>6) Cedric lives in a <strong>bungalow</strong> in Fife.</span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed learning about false friends, cognates and loanwords.

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this show we're talking about linking devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, linking devices. There are lots of different kinds, but today we're interested in words and phrases that link a <strong>cause</strong> – that's something that happens - with its <strong>effect</strong> <strong>or result.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So words and phrases like <strong>therefore, for that reason</strong> and <strong>because of. </strong>We'll tell you how they work…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>…We'll give you lots of examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>…And we'll finish off with a quiz to check what you've learnt.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So here we go. Let's start with an example. So Neil, do you prefer e-books or paper books?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I have to say, I'm a bit old fashioned: I like a good paper book.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Why's that then?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>It just feels more authentic.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, well, we're going to talk today, actually, about e-books, so can you give us an example sentence about e-books. Come on then Neil...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. There has been a fall in sales of paper books<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Except to you Neil. Now those two sentences are OK. But we could make them a lot clearer and more interesting by linking the ideas in them together with a word like <strong>consequently</strong>, like this.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. <strong>Consequently,</strong> there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Consequently</strong> is a very useful linking word. It shows that the event before the word <strong>consequently</strong> is the cause of the event after it. We could also use the words <strong>therefore, as a result, for that reason, thus</strong> or <strong>that's why.</strong> They all mean the same as <strong>consequently</strong>. And they are all used to join the ideas in two sentences or main clauses together.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Although remember that some are more formal than others. We use <strong>that's why</strong> a lot in informal everyday English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I missed the bus <strong>and that's why</strong> I'm late.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good example Catherine: it would sound wrong to say <strong>I missed the bus</strong> <strong>and therefore I'm late</strong>. Now can you give us an example of a more formal use of linking devices?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, try this one: There was a lot of opposition to the proposal; <strong>therefore,</strong> it was dropped.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Nice one. You can use <strong>consequently</strong> and <strong>thus</strong> instead of <strong>therefore</strong> in this type of sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. Now let's look at a group of words and phrases that we use to link cause and effect in a slightly different way.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some examples are: <strong>because of, as a result of, due to</strong> and <strong>owing to</strong>. Listen.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books, there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So how is that different? Well, <strong>due to</strong> is followed by a noun phrase – <strong>the increasing </strong><strong>popularity of e-books</strong> – not a complete sentence or main clause. We could also say <strong>due </strong><strong>to e-books increasing in popularity. </strong>That's a participle clause.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>due to</strong> joins a noun phrase or a participle clause to the main clause in the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. And <strong>as a result of, owing to</strong> or <strong>because of </strong>do too. We could use any of these in that example because they mean the same as <strong>due to</strong>. But <strong>because of</strong> is less formal than the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, and we could also put the sentence the other way round, like this Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There has been a fall in sales of paper books <strong>due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it just depends which part of the sentence you want to emphasize by putting first.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're looking at linking devices of cause and effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now for a couple of tips. When you start a sentence, in writing, with a noun phrase, be sure to use a comma after it.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fall in paper book sales,</strong> (comma) some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. But don't use a comma if the noun phrase comes at the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if we're using a verb phrase, we can introduce it with the phrase <strong>the fact that.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. You could say <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fact that book sales have fallen,</strong> some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And now it's quiz time! Complete these sentences. Number 1. Our climate is changing a) due to the Arctic ice is melting. b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The answer's b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done! Number 2. Lewis was promoted a) for that reason his hard work. b) as a result of his hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's b) as a result of his hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very good! Number 3. The accident happened a) owing to the fog on the motorway. b) owing to the fog was on the motorway.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>This time it's a) owing to the fog on the motorway.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done indeed! I hope wherever you are, you listened carefully to the show and <strong>as a result</strong> you got all the answers right.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's good and there's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Some useful phrases</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>In this session we're going to teach you some useful <strong>linking devices of cause and effect</strong>. To begin with, let's look at <strong>cause and effect</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>When we speak or write, we communicate ideas. Sometimes there is a direct link or connection between one idea and the next. Idea 1 happens, then something else happens as a result, which is idea 2.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>This is a <strong>cause and effect</strong> relationship. Take a look at this example:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>(Cause) The population has increased.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>(Effect) The government is going to build more houses.</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(Cause) There was a power cut.</em></li>\n<li><em>(Effect) I couldn't watch TV.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could link these ideas with a simple word like <strong>so.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased <strong>so</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n<li><em>There was a power cut <strong>so</strong> I couldn't watch TV.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But let's learn some more advanced ways, using <strong>linking devices</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong><span><span>Form</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Group 1: Therefore, consequently, as a result, thus</strong></p>\n<p><span><span>These are also called <strong>conjunctive</strong> <strong>adverbs</strong>, and they all behave in the same way. So h</span></span><span><span>ow do we use them to join ideas together? This is how we could do it with <strong>consequently</strong>. Notice the comma after <strong>consequently</strong>:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased. <strong>Consequently,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or we could join the two sentences together using a <strong>semi-colon</strong> <strong>+ consequently + comma</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased<strong>; consequently,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you <strong>can't</strong> just add <strong>consequently</strong> without a semi-colon or comma. This is wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has </em><em>increased <strong>consequently</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also replace <strong>consequently</strong> with any of the <strong>Group 1 </strong>words or phrases: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased. <strong>As a result,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n<li><em>The population has increased<strong>; therefore,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span><span>Note</span></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Therefore</strong> and <strong>consequently</strong> are used mainly in writing or formal speech. <strong>Thus</strong> is a little old-fashioned but is sometimes used in academic writing. <strong>That's why</strong> is very common in informal speech. In writing, we usually use it at the beginning of a sentence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The traffic was terrible.<strong> That's why</strong> I'm late.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Choose the correct answers. The first two questions will test your knowledge of cause and effect, the next four will test your ability to use linking devices from Group 1.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now we're going to look at the next group of linking devices. Join us on the next page!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Group 2 linking devices</h3>\n<p>Let's meet our next little group of linking devices: <strong>because of</strong>,<strong> as a result of</strong>,<strong> due to </strong>and<strong> owing to</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Noun phrases and participle clauses</strong></p>\n<p>With Group 2 linking devices, the <strong>cause </strong>part is not a whole sentence or clause, it's a <strong>noun phrase</strong> (a phrase that behaves like a noun) or <strong>participle clause </strong>(a short phrase that begins with a verb, usually in the<strong> -ing form</strong>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>interest rate rises</strong> (noun phrase)</li>\n<li><strong>rising interest rates</strong> (participle clause)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's imagine a <strong>cause and effect</strong> situation: interest rate rises are the <strong>cause </strong>of price increases. This is one way we could connect them using <strong>owing to</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>owing to</strong> <strong>interest rate rises</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>owing to rising interest rates</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>2) Position</strong></p>\n<p>In Group 1, the <strong>linking device </strong>usually comes <strong>between</strong> the <strong>cause</strong> and<strong> effect </strong>parts. <strong>Cause</strong> is always first, and <strong>effect</strong> is second.</p>\n<p>With Group 2, the <strong>cause</strong> can come first or second, and the <strong>linking device</strong> moves with it. Notice that you need a comma after the<strong> linking device</strong> if it's in the first part of the sentence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>As a result of interest rate rises</strong>, the problem has increased.</em></li>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>as a result of interest rate rises</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Take note: The fact that</strong></h3>\n<p>We can use a <strong>group 2 linking device +</strong> <strong>the fact that + a verb phrase:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>owing to the fact that interest rates are rising</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Take note: as a result</strong> and<strong> as a result of</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>As a result </strong>is in Group 1, and <strong>as a result of</strong> is in Group 2! They look very similar but behave differently.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>It's time to test yourself again.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now it's time for a good summary of all these points in 6 Minute Grammar.

Anna – the new manager of Tip Top Trading – has <strong>got her work cut out</strong>… I mean she's got a lot to do. Today she's holding an away day for everyone at the company - but unfortunately to save money the away day isn't away but at home in the office – and it's not a day either – just a morning. Anna's got to deliver some more bad news about saving money…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>I dunno, things must be bad – look they've only given us cheap biscuits to have with our tea – not those delicious Danish pastries we used to have…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>… I know and look - no Earl Green tea either…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>…No it's Earl Grey tea Denise… didn't you know that?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>[whispering] Anna are you OK? You're looking a bit nervous.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>I am. I've got some bad news to deliver – we might have to lose a member of staff to save money.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Oh that's hard – you need <strong>to handle</strong> this one carefully. Explain the situation and give them the back story.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>What's the back story?<br/><br/><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>The background to why the company is in this situation. Start by saying… 'Let me just fill you in with the background.'</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>OK. Here goes. [To team] Could you all take your seats please…</p>\n<p>[groans and grumbles as people sit down]</p>\n<p>Right. I hope you enjoyed your tea and biscuits…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[whispering] biscuit more like.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>… now for the second part of our away day we need to talk about staffing. Let me fill you in with the background… as you know we're working in tough economic conditions. Last year head office told us we had to improve sales by 10 per cent or face some serious <strong>consequences</strong> – and unfortunately we have only increased by seven per cent.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>I knew it! I'm going to be <strong>sacked</strong> – they always get rid of the woman who looks after the stationary first.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Well, you're not far off retirement anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>[tuts] Cheeky!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So Anna – whose fault is it that we haven't met our sales targets – not me, obviously!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Anna, you need to give them the reasons for not meeting the <strong>sales target</strong>. Say 'the reason we're in this situation in the first place is…' and tell them why.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>If you think it'll work then I'll give it a go.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Go on Anna – you'll be great.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>OK. Well Tom, you're right it's not all your fault – the reason we're in this situation in the first place is we had a problem on our production line and we didn't have enough plastic fruit to sell, Then there was the small fire in the warehouse when lots of our stock melted…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah – it was a meltdown!</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Ooo it was – I remember that fireman who had to carry me out of the building.<br/>Anyway, Anna, you've told us the reasons we're in the situation but what are we going to do now?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Well, as I said, we're three per cent short of meeting our sales target. So, I want you all to get into groups and have a <strong>brainstorm</strong> about a quick way to boost our sales so we can tell Head Office that we're going to meet that 10 per cent target after all. Off you go.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Great work Anna – what a leader! Despite having to deliver bad news, Anna has managed to explain the history of a situation and make everyone understand using the following phrases…<br/><br/><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Let's look at the backstory…<br/>The reason we're in this situation in the first place is…<br/>Let me just fill you in with the background….<br/>Let's just remind ourselves how we got here in the first place…</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Let's see how the team at Tip Top Trading are getting on…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Anna, Anna! I've got the answer…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Err… we've got the answer Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Go on then…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>According to this paperwork we make a weekly delivery to Mr Plum for… [looks at paperwork] …10 Perfectly Plastic fruit baskets - but Tom hasn't <strong>accounted for</strong> receiving the money.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Oh really? So let's remind ourselves how we got here in the first place, shall we? It was an accounting error by… Tom!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[making excuses] Seriously, no, listen. I've been too busy, what with the launch of the Awesome Apple and…<br/>[realising nobody believes him] You're not going to sack me are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Tom...</p> </div>",

Who can force themselves to do that boring piece of maths homework when they could be watching their favourite TV show instead? And who wants to pay a bill for something they don't even use?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>On such occasions, some people might think about lying. In this article, you'll read some real excuses that people have used. You might find it difficult to believe that only one of them isn't a real excuse.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p>Read this article quite quickly. It talks about various real excuses that people really have used. But one of them is not real - we made it up! Which one do you think is not a real excuse? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Terrible excuses</h3>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 1</strong><br>Have you ever taken a <strong>sickie</strong>? If so, what did you say to your boss? It seems many people in the UK like to blame their pets for their absence. One person said they couldn't come to work because their rabbit was missing. Perhaps that was a <strong>white lie</strong>; this next one though sounds more like a <strong>porky</strong>.</br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>A worker said that he couldn't come to work because he had to take his dog to the vet. This might seem reasonable - apart from the fact that the man told his boss his dog was dead as a previous excuse for <strong>skiving off</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>If you've ever worked as a teacher, you'll know that children can be very creative when it comes to excuses for not doing their homework. Once again, it's popular to blame pets. According to a BBC survey, almost 10 percent of excuses involve pets eating the <strong>assignment</strong>. \"The dog ate my homework\" is a <strong>legendary</strong> excuse - no one is sure if a student has ever really used it. More <strong>sinister</strong> is the claim that one pupil made: she said that she saw a ghost flying away with her homework in the night.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>But it's not just workplaces and schools which attract <strong>fibbers</strong>. People caught claiming <strong>welfare benefits</strong> illegally have also tried to <strong>con</strong> the authorities. A husband whose wife was working while also <strong>on the dole</strong> said that he didn't know she had a job because he was always in the <strong>garden shed</strong> during working hours.  </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>In the UK, people need to buy a licence in order to watch TV. And it's pets again that people rely on for their <strong>alibi</strong>. One man who didn't pay said, \"Apparently my dog, which is a corgi, was related to the Queen's dog so I didn't think I needed a TV licence\".</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>There are many more ridiculous excuses people have made for not doing the things they were supposed to do. But there isn't enough room on this page to fit them all. And besides, I can't carry on because the cat's eaten my keyboard.</span></span></p>\n<h3>Which excuse was not real?</h3>\n<p>We made up this excuse:</p>\n<p>\"More sinister is the claim that one pupil made: she said that she saw a ghost flying away with her homework in the night.\"</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge of <strong>linking devices of cause and effect</strong>. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Your terrible excuses</h3>\n<p>Have you ever made a bad excuse? We'd love to hear some!</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Vasyl, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>Once, when I went to school, I was late. Entered the premises I was caught by principal, consequently I was compelled to write an excuse of such a  misdeed. Owing to a great deal of time and calling bad weather to witness, I narrated a whole detective story in which I had been hiking and splashed up by car. As a result I came back home to change an attire. In excuse I noted the vehicle's brand, colour and even the registration number as though I could really recall it and it had the slightest importance!</p>\n<h3><strong>Manoel, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>The worst excuse I've ever made was ten years ago. I had forgotten completely my wife's birthday and when I came back home from the work, I heard my daughter giving congratulations to her mommy. I hadn't bought a present; as a result, I didn't know what to say. Then I told a white lie. I said to her that I really bought a gift, but when I was coming home, I saw a very sad poor woman. I felt sorry and I gave her the present that I've bought.</p>\n<h3>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>I would like to tell about one of my bad excuse to refuse drinking alcoholic drinks.</p>\n<p>First of all, let me just fill you in with background. There is a fact that Vietnamese use too much alcoholic drinks, brandy in particular, whereas fake and imitation ones are widespread on the market. As consequently, it is really high risk for the drinkers. In addition, I am really not good at drinking. I therefore always refuse whenever to be offered to drink and I always excuse by saying that I have a problem with my stomach that the doctor directed to keep away from alcoholic drinks. It is a white lie, of course, but it worked. </p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>Hello everybody, really yes, I have made several bad excuses in my life, but the worst excuse that I have made it was when I was studying at the college school. Let me just fill you in with the background...three years ago, I had to take a test of the subject of fuzzy control, but the last night before the test, I went to a party with my friends and we started to drink different kind of alcoholic drinks and the next day I had a terrible hangover and I was to call to the university and I told them that I crashed my car the last night and I was arrested that night. Two days after, Finally I took the test but, I lost it.</p>\n<h3>Aroa, Spain</h3>\n<p>What I am going to tell you is not an excuse, it is something it really happened to me. Anyway it seems an excuse and it is very funny.</p>\n<p>It was my cousin's wedding so I got home really tired at night. I left my ID card and my driving license on the sofa and I went straight to bed. The following day I didn't find either the license or the ID card. I spent one week looking for both things. Unfortunately I didn't found them and I needed the ID card because i was going to travel so I had to renew it. After some time one day we were tidying up the drawers which were under the bed and suddenly we found both, the ID card and the driving license. Obviously they both had been bitten by my dog who seemed to have been playing with them the night of the wedding. Although the driving license was broken I didn't have the new one so I have to put that in my wallet. That night I was driving when suddenly the police stopped me and asked me for the driving license. I was really really embarrased but I had to tell him that my dog had eaten my driving license. The police got a bit angry, he thought it was an excuse but I showed it to him. When he saw that he started to laugh. Thanks goodness I didn't get a fine.</p>\n<h3>Marco</h3>\n<p>Last winter, a morning I decided to stay at home avoiding to go to my work, so I invented an excuse not very brilliant. Infact I remember it was a nice day in the winter, but I called my boss telling him that there was a terrible snow storm on my village. Unfortunately my house is far from my factory only 15 kilometers. To conclude, the day after my colleagues, while I was trying to explain my terrible excuse to my boss, they kidded me imitating a man that is removing the snow.</p>\n<h3>Pierre, Belgium</h3>\n<p>Hereafter is a white lie I used to avoid to go to work:</p>\n<p>This was a day on Augustus. My boss was on holiday. At that time, my workplace was at about 120 kilometres from my house. On this morning, I didn't want to drive and I sent a message to my colleagues:</p>\n<p>\"Hi there, I'm sorry but my car seems to have a problem. The battery seems to be low. The car doesn't start. I won't be able to come at work.\"</p>\n<p>I was stupid because my car was new and all my colleagues understood the lie. The boss was on holiday; consequently, there was no consequences. But I'm ashamed to have let my colleagues worked more because of me. This will never happen again.</p>\n<h3>Marisol, Spain</h3>\n<p>I've never used any excuses for not working, but I know some people who they are real expertes.</p>\n<p>One day, a colleague called to our workplace and she said that she couldn't go to work because of she had the ash's grandfather in her car and she couldn't leave here.</p>\n<p>Another colleague said us that he couldn't go on time every day owing to he had to go out with his dog in the morning and he couldn't go earlier due to it was colder and his pet could get a bad cold.</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I used to do bad excuses for my skiving off. These were mainly in school and I taken sickie. For examples, I missed a particular class and when I faced with a teacher as excuse I always told that I was sick and that's why I wasn't attended in the classroom. Fortunately or not, I have never taken a sickie in my job.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>When I was a child, I often used to wake up late in the morning and, consequently, I often used to be late for school. Since everybody knew, including my teacher, that my house was beside the school, I always had to make up new excuses and every time I entered the classroom, my teacher asked me, ironically, questions such as 'What happened this time? Was the lift in your building on strike? Did your brother take the battery out of your alarm clock for his walkman? Did your dog hide your clothings? Parking problems?”. Fortunately, my teacher was a very tolerant person.</p>\n<h3>Ahmed</h3>\n<p>I'd like to tell you about our colleague big excuse that, all of us thought is was a serious matter, Let me fill you in with the backstory. <br/> our colleague decided to lift our company whereas he had just got a promotion hence, he was shy and didn't find any thing to tell except a huge lie! thus, he told us that he's sick and will need a serious surgery he even more visited our office wearing medical equipment and he decided to sign-off in order to make the surgery and don't waste company time with his health issue! and after few months we knew that he lift to comparative company.</p>\n<h3>Francesco, Italy</h3>\n<p>I hate to be late; consequently, I'm always just in time so I don't have to excuse me to anyone.</p>\n<p>Only once, when I was child, I came to school late because of I met Spiderman during a fight with a monster; consequently, I gave him my help to kill the monster. </p>\n<p>Another time, when I was 30, I was late to work because of Batman gave me his car but I didn't know how  land.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of situations that may embarrass us; as result, we have to learn how find a good solution.</p>\n<p>I think and hope, that all the people around the world will be able.</p>\n<h3>Rita, Spain</h3>\n<p>I have to recognize that the worst excuse i have ever given was not addressed to another person but myself. </p>\n<p>I was operated from a disc hernia and due to the fact that it wasn´t a success, i needed to be operated twice more. </p>\n<p>This happened along 5 years´ time and in the following  5 years i had a lot of suffering  owing to the pain.Therefore, i tried many therapies as rehabilitation, accupunture, quiropractics, and ozon therapy. They seemed to work for two or three months  and after that relief period,  i returned to feel so bad as before again. </p>\n<p>The point is that i had convinced myself about my own unability to recover because of my negative mental attitude.</p>\n<p>Later, big changes happenned in my life: getting divorced and moving to another town made me realize that i  could really get bettter, with some effort and lots of constance.</p>\n<p>Finally I am living on my own, with some handicaps but i am dong things i could never have imagined when i was cheated by my own mental excuses.</p>\n<h3>Pawan Bhandari, Nepal</h3>\n<p>Chucking a sickie was my bad habit when I read in school; consequently,  I had to make do on very few notes during the exams. My habit worsened when I missed the terminal exam owing to the fabrication of a lie that I was sick.  It was this time I made up the story that I had caught jaundice; but in fact, I had very minor headache. I was very apprehensive about my Principal asking me the medication report. But thankfully,  he believed me as I had told my mother to say so. Today, I remorse my wrong doings; I feel , if I hadn't been involved in pulling sickies, I would have got the better result. </p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, as a student, there are some days where I don't want to do anything. So these days I made some terrible excuses to myself in order to avoid doing my homework. For instance, a very bad reason I often give to myself for not doing my homework is the fact that it's raining outside. Shame on me...</p>\n<p>There we can notice that a terrible excuse to yourself can be the origin of new meaningless excuses to other people. To go on with the example previously given, from there, my parents can notice that I'm doing nothing, so they may probably call me for houseworks. Then I will have to invent a new excuse to escape from the household chores.</p>\n<p>Finally it's a kind of a vicious circle : a lie leads to another.</p>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>How was that? You have lots of excuses now. We hope you don't try to use them. Join us in Session 5 for the final part of our drama, Jamaica Inn. Mary finally discovers who murdered her aunt and uncle. Now she needs help - but who can she turn to?</p></div>",

Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>…and me, Neil. In this programme, we’re looking at reporting verbs. They’re verbs that we use when we talk about what someone else has said.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So verbs like <strong>suggest</strong>, <strong>deny</strong> and <strong>insist. </strong>Let’s start by listening to Simon. And Simon is a political news reporter.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And while you’re listening to Simon’s news report, here’s a question for you to think about:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Why did the minister lie in her previous interview?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Simon<br/></strong></span><span>In a previous interview, the minister had <strong>denied</strong> knowing anything about the scandal. However, she later <strong>apologised for</strong> saying this and <strong>admitted</strong> that she had lied. She <strong>insisted</strong> that she had not intended to cause any harm and <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures. When <strong>advised</strong> to reconsider her position, she had initially <strong>demanded</strong> to know why, but eventually <strong>offered</strong> to resign.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We asked: Why did the minister lie in her previous interview?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: she <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Scandal. Now it’s interesting that the report uses the verb <strong>suggested</strong>. So why didn’t Simon use <strong>said</strong> - She <strong>said</strong> that…?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, <strong>suggested</strong> tells us that the minister said it, but not in a very strong or direct way. And that’s because she didn’t want to embarrass the important public figures. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that’s an example of why reporting verbs are useful. We can always use <strong>say, tell</strong> or <strong>ask</strong>, but other reporting verbs express slightly different meanings and attitudes. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they do. So reporting verbs make your writing or speaking more accurate and more interesting too. Now listen for more reporting verbs in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>CLIP 1           <br/></strong>In a previous interview, the minister had <strong>denied</strong> knowing anything about the scandal. However, she later <strong>apologised</strong> <strong>for</strong> saying this and <strong>admitted</strong> that she had lied.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we heard<strong> denied knowing anything. Denied</strong> has a negative meaning. It means she said she didn’t know anything about the scandal. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. But then she<strong> apologised for saying this. </strong>She said she was sorry for saying this.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And lastly, she <strong>admitted that she had lied</strong>. <strong>Admit </strong>is the opposite of<strong> deny. </strong>It means you say that something is true. We usually use <strong>admit</strong> when someone has to say that something is true, although they would prefer not to.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now on to the next clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>She <strong>insisted</strong> that she had not intended to cause any harm and <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There we heard the verb <strong>insisted</strong>. <strong>To insist</strong> means to say something strongly, especially when other people say something different.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the minister said strongly that it was incorrect that she had intended to cause harm.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now we’ve already looked at the verb <strong>suggested</strong>. But it’s worth noticing that <strong>insist, suggest</strong> and <strong>admit</strong> are all followed by a <strong>that clause</strong> in the news report.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>For example, <strong>she suggested that it had been necessary</strong>. But we often leave the word <strong>that</strong> out – <strong>she suggested it had been necessary</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Other reporting verbs have different patterns. Some verbs are followed by a <strong>verb plus i-n-g</strong>, such as <strong>deny</strong>.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And some are followed by <strong>to plus an infinitive</strong>. You’ll hear three example of this in our final clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>CLIP 3<br/></strong></span><span>When <strong>advised</strong> to reconsider her position, she had initially <strong>demanded</strong> to know why, but eventually <strong>offered</strong> to resign.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Right. We heard <strong>advised</strong>, which means <strong>told,</strong> but in a polite or indirect way.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>demanded, </strong>which means <strong>asked</strong> in a slightly aggressive way.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And finally she <strong>offered to resign</strong>. So she said that she was willing to resign if that’s what people wanted.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right, quiz time! Which three reporting verbs from the show today can you use instead of <strong>said</strong> in these sentences?  Number one. I didn’t believe her at first but she <strong>said</strong> that it was true.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It’s<strong> insisted. </strong>She<strong> insisted </strong>that it was true.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That’s right. Well done! Number two: When questioned by the police, the boy <strong>said</strong> that he had stolen the car.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So the boy <strong>admitted</strong> that he had stolen the car. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Number three: Several people have said that there’s a possibility that the actor’s marriage might be in trouble.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer’s<strong> suggested</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It is! And that’s the end of the quiz. Congratulations if you got them all right!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well done indeed. And finally, here’s a top tip to help you learn new words more quickly. Keep a list of reporting verbs and study their meanings. When you are writing, every time you use the words <strong>said</strong>,<strong> asked</strong> or <strong>told</strong>, check your list to see if there is a different verb that you can use in that context to add variety to your English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And there’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>. <strong> </strong>Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p> </div>",

They're used more often in writing than speaking, and are especially common in journalism.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>For example, a recent news story about the British economy said:</span></span></p>\n<p><em>As the chancellor presented the first Conservative Budget in 20 years, he <strong>insisted</strong> that Britain had \"turned a corner\".</em></p>\n<p><span><span>In other words, the chancellor <strong>said firmly</strong> that Britain had \"turned a corner\" (come out of a difficult situation). We often use <strong>insist</strong> when we know that not everyone agrees with what we are saying.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>To test how well you understand these verbs, you're going to complete some quotes adapted from BBC news stories. Think about what each sentence means and choose the most appropriate verb.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. One more thing to learn is which words come after these verbs. Do we say <strong>advise to</strong> or <strong>advise that</strong>? Find out in the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The grammar of reporting verbs</h3>\n<p>Knowing how to use <strong>reporting verbs</strong> correctly in a sentence is important. In our examples so far, you may have noticed that some verbs are followed by <strong>'that' +</strong> <strong>clause</strong>, some are followed by <strong>verb-ing</strong> (a gerund), and some are followed by a <strong>preposition</strong>.</p>\n<p>We're now going to look at what comes after <strong>reporting verbs</strong>. Some verbs appear more than once because they can be used in different ways.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Reporting verb + 'that' + clause: </strong>admit, deny, insist, suggest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He <strong>admitted that he was mean</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>The <strong>suspect denied that he was at the scene of the crime</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>We <strong>insist that you join us for dinner</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>I <strong>suggest that you arrive early</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>People often leave out the <strong>that</strong> in spoken English. The meaning is the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I suggest you arrive early.</em></li>\n<li><em>We insist you join us for dinner.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) Reporting verb + verb-ing: </strong>deny, suggest</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Lucia <strong>denied meeting</strong> the businessman last week.</em></li>\n<li><em>Mark <strong>suggested buying</strong> stocks in the IT firm.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) Reporting verb + preposition + verb-ing: </strong>apologise, insist</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>She <strong>apologised for forgetting </strong>my birthday.</em></li>\n<li><em>We <strong>insisted on sharing</strong> the cost of the meal</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>You can also apologise <strong>to </strong>someone<strong> (apologise + to + object)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Baz <strong>apologised to Lucia</strong> for forgetting her birthday.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) Reporting verb + 'to' + infinitive: </strong>demand, offer</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Barry <strong>demanded to know</strong> the answer.</em></li>\n<li><em>Brutus <strong>offered to pay</strong> for the damage.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5) Reporting verb + indirect object + infinitive: </strong>advise</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I <strong>advised him to</strong> apply.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6) Reporting verb + indirect object + 'that' + clause: </strong>advise</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I <strong>advised him that he should apply</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First, read this short story. Then you're going to use reporting verbs to make sentences about it. As we said, people don't always say the <strong>that</strong> before a clause, but in this game you need to include <strong>that</strong> to show you understand the full form. And as you can see, the verbs <strong>advise</strong>, <strong>insist</strong>, <strong>deny</strong>, <strong>suggest</strong> and <strong>apologise</strong>, can be followed by different words. In questions with one of these verbs, the words you are given will allow you to make only one correct form.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>Lucian and Martina were deeply in love, but they argued a lot. Martina was unhappy because Lucian never arrived anywhere on time, and because he never said sorry. Lucian thought Martina should be more generous and buy him presents. Martina disagreed. A friend said they should separate for a short time. Neither of them wanted to, but they did in the end. After a week apart, they got back together and started arguing again.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Well done. If you'd like to practise these again, we <strong>suggest</strong> you go back to Activity 1 and listen to 6 Minute Vocabulary! If not, we'll see you in Session 2.</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And me, Neil.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Neil, have a sandwich. It's from Finn. He said you were hungry.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Really?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Yes! He said... In fact, Finn said: \"He's hungry. Give him a sandwich.\" </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! That's very kind of Finn. It's delicious.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And in today's programme we're talking about reported speech. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We'll be discussing why and when we use it. And we'll see how to form it...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use reported speech when we want to report something that another person said. In o</span><span>ur example, Finn originally said:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span><strong>He's hungry.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's direct speech. Catherine reported the direct speech, like this:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Finn said you were hungry.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's look at that more closely. We need to make some grammatical changes when we report what someone else says. First, when the speaker or listener changes, we need to change the pronouns.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Finn used <strong>he</strong> in direct speech to talk about Neil:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span><strong>He</strong> is hungry. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Then Catherine told me what Finn said.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Finn said <strong>you</strong> were hungry.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Second change: In reported speech we often move the tense back one step into the past. So <strong>is hungry</strong> becomes <strong>were hungry</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>But we don't have to change the verb tense in reported speech if the situation is generally true. Here's an example. Finn, give us a sentence please:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>OK. I <strong>love</strong> cheese sandwiches. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Thank you, Finn. And Neil, can you report what Finn said, please?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Yes. Finn said he <strong>loves</strong> cheese sandwiches. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK. So there we don't change <strong>loves</strong> to <strong>loved</strong>, because Finn loves cheese sandwiches and that's a general truth. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now the third thing we need with reported speech is a reporting verb. <strong>Say</strong> and <strong>tell</strong> are the most common ones. And we usually put them in the past tense. For example: Finn <strong>said</strong> Neil was hungry.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Now let's look at how to report questions with question words like <strong>What</strong> and <strong>Who</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We'll hear the direct speech first from Finn, then Catherine will give us the reported speech. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>What's the time?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Finn asked what the time was.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The reporting verb comes first, then the question word, and then the reported sentence with the tense moved back. And don't forget to change the word order from question word order to statement word order. Another one please Finn and Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Who ate the cake?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>He asked who'd eaten the cake.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>OK, now it's time to look at pronunciation. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, pronuciation. Some past tense forms in reported speech can be difficult to hear. In the last example, the two words <strong>who</strong> and <strong>had</strong> become who'd. He asked who'd eaten the cake.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a <strong>/d/</strong> sound. Listen out for the short <strong>/d/</strong> sound in this next example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>She asked where I'd gone.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, the phrase <strong>I had</strong> becomes <strong>I'd</strong>. One more time please Finn:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>She asked where I'd gone.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Thank you, Finn. So watch out for contractions in reported speech.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And now are you ready?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>For a quiz?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's quiz time! Finn is going to say some sentences in direct speech. As you listen, decide what the correct reported speech is. Here's the first one.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>I've eaten my lunch.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Is the reported speech a) He said he's eating his lunch or b) He said he'd eaten his lunch?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And the answer is b) He said he'd eaten his lunch. The present perfect changes to the past perfect. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>OK. Next one please Finn:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>I go to work by bus.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Is the reported speech a) Finn said he goes to work by bus or b) Finn said he's going to work by bus?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And it's a) Finn said he goes to work by bus. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>OK. And here's the last one: </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Where are my glasses?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Is it a) He asked where were his glasses or b) He asked where his glasses were?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And the right answer is b) He asked where his glasses were.  </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Now, before we go, there’s just enough time for a top tip. With the reporting verb <strong>tell</strong> we say who the person is talking to, for example, Finn <strong>told me</strong> he's going to pay for lunch today.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Wow!

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Jarek's travels</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Reported speech </strong>is a big topic. In Activities 1 and 2 we're going to concentrate on two aspects – how tenses change, and how we make questions.</p>\n<p>But first, let's look at what we mean by reported speech.</p>\n<p>Imagine you've just received an international call from your brother Jarek. He's travelling in South East Asia. Your mother wants to know what he said.</p>\n<p>You could repeat what he said, using <strong>direct speech</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>Jarek said: \"I'm feeling a bit lonely.\"</em></p>\n<p>Or you could use <strong>reported speech</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>Jarek said he was feeling a bit lonely.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What changes?</strong></p>\n<p>Did you notice how the tense changed?</p>\n<p><strong>I'm feeling lonely</strong> became <strong>he was feeling lonely</strong>. The tense moved <strong>from present continuous</strong> to <strong>past continuous</strong>.</p>\n<p>And the pronoun changed. <strong>I </strong>changed to <strong>he</strong>.</p>\n<p>Normally, if the <strong>reporting verb</strong> is in the past tense, like <strong>said</strong> in this example, we also change the reported statement into the past tense.</p>\n<p>But if you keep the reporting verb in the present tense, the reported statement stays the same. Imagine you are telling your mum what Jarek is saying, line by line:</p>\n<p><em>Jarek </em><strong><em>says </em></strong><strong><em>he's feeling</em></strong><em> a bit lonely… But he </em><strong><em>says </em></strong><strong><em>he is enjoying</em></strong><em> himself… He </em><strong><em>says </em></strong><strong><em>the weather is</em></strong><em> really lovely.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Moving one tense back</strong></h3>\n<p>In reported speech, we normally move the <strong>direct speech</strong> main verb one step back in the past. Look at these examples:</p>\n<p><strong>1)   </strong><strong>Present simple -&gt; past simple</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>know</em></strong><em> you.\" -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>knew</em></strong><em> him.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2)   </strong><strong>Present continuous -&gt; past continuous</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>am having</em></strong><em> coffee\" -&gt; He said he </em><strong><em>was </em></strong><strong><em>having</em></strong><em> coffee.</em></p>\n<p><strong>3)   </strong><strong>Present perfect -&gt; past perfect</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>have </em></strong><strong><em>finished</em></strong><em> my homework\" -&gt; He said he </em><strong><em>had finished</em></strong><em> his homework.</em></p>\n<p><strong>4)   </strong><strong>Present perfect continuous -&gt; past perfect continuous</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>have been </em></strong><strong><em>studying</em></strong><em> Chinese\" -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>had been studying</em></strong><em> Chinese.</em></p>\n<p><strong>5)   </strong><strong>Is going to -&gt; was going to</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>am going to</em></strong><em> go home\" -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>was going to</em></strong><em> go home.</em></p>\n<p><strong>6)   </strong><strong>Future simple - &gt; would</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>will go</em></strong><em> to the bank later\" -&gt; He said he </em><strong><em>would go</em></strong><em> to the bank later.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Notes </strong></h3>\n<p>1) A reported statement in the<strong> past simple </strong>often stays the same:</p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>drove</em></strong><em> to work\" -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>drove</em></strong><em> to work.</em></p>\n<p>2) And you can't go further back in time than the <strong>past perfect</strong>, so it stays the same too:</p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>had driven</em></strong><em> to work\" -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>had driven</em></strong><em> to work.</em></p>\n<p>3) <strong>Modal verbs</strong>: some change in reported speech:</p>\n<p><em>“I </em><strong><em>can/can't</em></strong><em> speak Turkish” -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>could/couldn't</em></strong><em> speak Turkish.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I </em><strong><em>must/mustn't</em></strong><em> wash my hair” -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>had to/didn't have to</em></strong><em> wash her hair.</em></p>\n<p>4) Some modal verbs don't change:</p>\n<p><em>“I </em><strong><em>could</em></strong><em> take the bus” -&gt; He said he </em><strong><em>could</em></strong><em> take the bus.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I </em><strong><em>should</em></strong><em> go to bed” -&gt; She said she </em><strong><em>should</em></strong><em> go to bed.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I </em><strong><em>might</em></strong><em> watch TV” -&gt; He said he </em><strong><em>might</em></strong><em> watch TV.</em></p>\n<p>5) We don’t change the verb in reported speech if the situation hasn’t changed, for example if it’s a fact or is generally true:</p>\n<p><em>\"I </em><strong><em>love</em></strong><em> you\" -&gt; She told me she </em><strong><em>loves</em></strong><em> me.</em></p>\n<p>6) But we can use the past tense to show you're not certain the other person loves her/him – for example, the other person wasn’t telling the truth.</p>\n<p><em>\"I love you\" -&gt; She said she <strong>loved</strong> me.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Here's the rest of Jarek's phone call. It's a bad phone line and you only hear a few sentences. Can you change it into reported speech to tell your mother afterwards?</p>\n<h3><strong>Jarek's phone call</strong></h3>\n<p><em>\"I'm sitting in a beautiful train station… This is expensive so I don't have a lot of time… I lost my laptop so I can't check my email every day… But I'll call you when I find a guesthouse with Wifi…I'm going to travel to Ayutthaya tomorrow to see the temples… I've tried so many new kinds of food… I ate some really spicy soup today. I miss you!\"</em></p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next we have a look at how to use reported speech in questions.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The hot date</h3>\n<p>You've been on a date and your best friend wants to know all about it. To tell her, you're going to need reported speech, including reported questions. Let's take a look at these.</p>\n<p>A <strong>direct question</strong> is: <em>Where are you from?</em></p>\n<p>A <strong>reported question</strong> is: <em>He asked where I was from.</em></p>\n<p>To form a reported question, you need to follow these steps:</p>\n<p>1) Use a reporting verb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He <strong>asked</strong> where I was from.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) Repeat the question word:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He asked <strong>where</strong> I was from.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>3) Change the pronouns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He asked where <strong>I</strong> was from.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>4) Move the tense back (note: you don't have to move the tense back when you're talking about general truths):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He asked where I <strong>was</strong> from.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>5) Use statement word order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He asked where <strong>I was from</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Note: Yes/no questions</strong></h3>\n<p>For<strong> yes/no questions</strong>, we use<strong> if </strong>or<strong> whether</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Example: Is it two o'clock?</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>She asked if it was two o'clock.</em></li>\n<li><em>She asked whether it was two o'clock.</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to tell your friend all about your date. She wants to know what you asked each other. Which means you have the perfect opportunity to practise <strong>reported questions</strong>!</p>\n<p>Here are some of the questions your date asked you.</p>\n<p>\"How are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you having a nice time?\"</p>\n<p>\"Where do you live?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can I stay with you tonight?\"</p>\n<p>\"Will you marry me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you forgive me?\"</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>It sounds like an exciting date! Time for 6 Minute Grammar with Neil and Catherine. You'll hear a summary of all these points and do a fun quiz.

Well, they might blush, maybe behave strangely... or say something weird, right? Wrong. Some liars are very confident and they can trick others for years. Liars can be very charming and know exactly what to say to get others to believe them. Here are some of the lies many of us believed.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Here's an article about four famous lies. There are similarities between each example. Read the article the first time quite quickly and decide which one of these three sentences is not true about all four of the famous liars. The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p>\n<p>1. They were all very confident when lying.</p>\n<p>2. There were official investigations when they were caught.</p>\n<p>3. They went to jail.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>The American <strong>stockbroker </strong>Bernard Madoff promised to deliver gains nobody else in the market could. His clients believed him, forgetting that if something is too good to be true, it's either not really that good or simply not true. Madoff was in fact a <strong>swindler</strong>. He used money from new investors to pay old ones and kept the illusion going. This is what is known as a '<strong>pyramid scheme</strong>'. In 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in jail for a fraud that robbed investors of £40bn. He toldhis victims he had no excuse for his behaviour.</br></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2<br/></strong>Body language isn't always a good way to tell if someone is telling a <strong>whopper</strong>. US President Bill Clinton looked straight at the TV camera when he denied he had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. It was 1998 and his behaviour was under investigation during a <strong>sexual harassment lawsuit</strong>. It was filed by a former Arkansas government employee that Clinton had worked with, Paula Jones.  Reports came out that he'd had an affair with another employee, Lewinsky. In the end, the president had to admit that he <strong>misled </strong>people. Bill Clinton had to give a public show of <strong>regret</strong>. He was <strong>impeached</strong> by the House of Representatives but spared by the Senate.  </p>\n<p><strong>Part 3<br/></strong>Regret didn't come easily to American cyclist Lance Armstrong. After years of denials he admitted in a 2013 interview with US talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he took <strong>performance-enhancing drugs</strong> during his seven Tour de France victories. The athlete confessed that because he kept <strong>getting away with</strong> <strong>it</strong> he didn't even fear being caught by <strong>anti-doping</strong> officials anymore. Armstrong lost his titles and was banned from the sport for life. </p>\n<p><strong>Part 4<br/></strong>Some liars relax too much after they think they have successfully <strong>fooled</strong> everybody. This was John Darwin's biggest mistake. The Briton <strong>faked</strong> his own death in a canoe accident to allow his wife to get his life insurance money. Darwin walked into a police station after five years 'dead' <strong>claiming</strong> he didn't remember where he had been. The police were suspicious after a picture of the couple with a estate agent in Panama appeared in the press. With a lot of money in their pockets they planned to move to the Latin American country. 'Canoe man', as the newspapers called him, and his wife were sentenced to more than six years in jail.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe it is not easy to spot a liar after all. You have to <strong>keep your wits about you </strong>to prevent these people <strong>pulling the wool over your eyes</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Which of these is not true?</strong></h3>\n<p>3. They went to jail.</p>\n<p>That's not true. Only Bernard Madoff went to jail. Lance Armstrong was banned and Bill Clinton was impeached but neither went to jail.</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are more questions for you to check how much of the article you can understand and how well you've learnt <strong>reporting verbs</strong>. Read the article again and go for it!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Big lies you've believed</strong></h3>\n<p>Has anyone ever told you a big lie? Did you believe them? How did you find out the person was not telling the truth? Do you have tips on how to recognise when someone is not telling the truth?</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Hương Hoàng </h3>\n<p>Have you ever been lied by the person you trusted most? For me this was an unforgettable story that made me keep my wits about others.</p>\n<p>I am a student and due to the expensive expenses in the big city, I have to share my accommodation with my friend. At first, we haven't known about each other, just met by chance and studied at the same university, I believed that we can handed all the problems well by resigning ourselves. But things never go as you think. We didn't have much argument but others incurred. More and more items disappeared. I had no doubt about her until I found my computer was stolen when I was far away. I insisted on her that she was a thief but she blamed that his boyfriend took it. I felt sorry and sad. She should have apologized for instead of denying. I broke this relation and felt shock because this is the first and worse experience I ever had since I was far away from my parents.</p>\n<p>I know life is difficult and there are more challenges and I have to cope with people who are pulling the wool over your eyes.</p>\n<h3><strong>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</strong></h3>\n<p>I believe that many people among us have at least one time in life given changes to some beggar with a true compassion. It seems sensible to mention, but you are absolutely able to be misled in this case.</p>\n<p>One day, I was on the way home when I saw a dismal man begging at the street corner with a serious large burn on one leg that looks gangrening. He was sitting on the ground with a piece of cardboard said that his leg would be cut due to gangrene of the wound if it was not treated timely and that he could not afford the money of the treatment and, of course, with a hat that was turned upside down in front of him to collect the donate. Many pedestrians donated him. I did too.</p>\n<p>I quickly found that we were all swindled when a pedestrian recognized the man who was in fact a swindler and posted the truth on the Internet. The man faked his burn and had begged with the same scenario all around Hanoi. He had misled many people until  disappeared when his trick was out.</p>\n<p>We usually do charity or donate without doubt. I do not advise you not doing so, but let keep your wits about you. </p>\n<h3>Khalid, Yemen</h3>\n<p>I consider this event as the biggest fraud case happened in sight of my eyes. I was with my brother's friend guiding him in the city, because he was living in countryside. We were at a hospital to take the result of his medical tests which was required to get a visa. The important thing is the result was negative, so he was so happy. Just after we'd taken the result and gone out the hospital, we met a man who had a watch for sell. He claimed it was Swiss watch and he needed money to pay bills of his father treatment otherwise he would not sell it, we told him that we were not interested, so he asked us where he could sell it. When I was telling him where he could sell his watch, A man who was wearing suite and seemed important came to the three of us and said that he wanted the watch.</p>\n<p>They didn't agree on a price, so the suitman offered giving us money for free if we made him agree, and he went to bring money. I told my friend we should leave them, because the suitman wanted to exploit the watchman, he refused, and the suitman didn't appear again.</p>\n<p>As a result, he decided to sell his watch for my friend for lower price and my friend agreed he wanted to have happy day. My friend took the watch and asked two people who were looking dignified, and old men, they recommended buying the watch and said it was worth more than 1000 USD. </p>\n<p>Finally, he bought it for 700 USD, and we went home. In our way to home we asked a person who was working in a shop of Swiss watches about it, he said it's real price less than 100 USD.</p>\n<p>We didn't believe that and he asked me didn't tell anybody about that especially his father, I promised I wouldn't tell anybody.</p>\n<h3>Nadia, France</h3>\n<p>A friend ever told me a big lie that I believed. I never find out on her. I knew my friend was a liar because she came out her lie on her own. She repeated her liar to other people who don't believe it.</p>\n<p>I didn't have tips to recognise if someone is lying or not. Some people lie and we can read it on his, her face.</p>\n<p>There are characteristics behaviours, coming out of the ordinary: a small smile, a gesture on the face.</p>\n<p>There also are lies that anyone can't see and those are more difficult to recognise.</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately I was fooled once. The fact is that in our country exist job offers when you are offered a job with a higher salary. All you should do is just to call their telephone number. But the number is not simple. You call every minute and the call takes away fantastic money from you.  And you will lose all the money in the account  or later will come a huge bill if it is a landline phone.</p>\n<p>These job offers they propose are to collect pens or envelopes. But if you think logically, the pens and envelopes are produced at the factory and there is not need in your part. But then I only finished university and started to search for a job without knowing these nuances.  I called from a fixed line I got a huge bill and I was forced to pay it.</p>\n<p>My recommendations for job seekers is when you search for a job pay attention to advertisement. A serious company always puts requirements to candidates and don't write like this: \"The job for all, regardless of age and level of education\". Likely that this is fraud. So keep your wits about you and don't let them pull the wool over your eyes.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>Over the years, I have been deceived so many times that I would be spoilt for choice on what to tell. Anyway, one of the worst lies was the invention of new miraculous methods to learn English language in a very short period of time. Who wouldn't want to believe that? But then I realized that learning a foreign language is a matter of years and daily hard work that, I am sure, sooner or later will pay off.</p>\n<h3>Claudio, Venosa, Italy</h3>\n<p>I agree, often it's no easy to find if someone is telling a lie. I remember a joke I did with some friends of mine. Annoyed because they ate my special chocolates, without wrapping, I told them that they were rat poison. I was a very good liar. I told them that I was joking only when we arrived in emergency room. I enjoyed very much. It was better than eating the chocolate.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>Yes off course one time, I met a person in my college. He told me a big lie. that lie was about his parents. he told me that he needed a bit money for pay the taxes of  parent's house. I gave a  loan but when I discovered that his parents are dead, I tried to warn all my friend but was too late He misled me and fooled some of them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately some swindlers are very smart and is too hard to recognise when they are telling lies but I try to look them in the eyes when they speak, if they can't look at me I start to suspect about them.</p>\n<h3>Rosangela, Brazil</h3>\n<p>The Trojan Horse</p>\n<p>When Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, was kidnapped, the Greeks decided to wage a war against Troy. The fighting lasted ten years and looked like Troy, protected by its high walls, was the winner. But the Greeks had a cunning idea: they built a huge wooden horse that hid soldiers in its hollow interior. Then communicated to the enemy that the horse was a peace offering. Thus, the Trojans accepted the gift and took him inside the walls. That night, as Troy was asleep, the Greeks left the horse and opened the gates to his army, which was decisive in defeating the Trojans. This may have been one of the greatest lies in history and one of the best war tricks is, of course, is true. I still do not know if the episode really happened or if it's just a legend.</p>\n<p><strong>End of Session 4</strong></p>\n<p>How was that? Nobody fools you now, do they? Join us in Session 5 for our new drama, The Importance of Being Earnest. In episode 1 we meet the charming Algernon and mysterious Earnest.</p></div>",

I'm Catherine.</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And I'm Finn. Actually Catherine, sorry I'm late. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>You should be.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>It's <strong>taken</strong> me forever to get here! </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>I know.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><span>The bus <strong>took</strong> hours. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Oh did it really, Finn? But you usually <strong>take</strong> the train.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I missed it today. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK, no problem. Because actually, Finn, you've introduced today's topic with the words: <strong>take, took, taken</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Ah yes, irregular verbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. We're going to look at three different groups of irregular verbs. So, let's start by listening to Mike and Neil's conversation. And poor Mike can't find his phone.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Oh no. While you listen, think about this question: How many times has Abdullah rung?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>Have you <strong>seen</strong> my phone, Neil?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I haven't <strong>taken </strong>it. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I didn't <strong>say</strong> you <strong>'took'</strong> it. I just <strong>said</strong> 'Have you <strong>seen</strong> it?'</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I <strong>saw</strong> it on your desk this morning.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I can't <strong>see</strong> it here! I've got to <strong>ring</strong> Abdullah. He <strong>rang </strong>again today. He<strong>'s rung </strong>me five times this week...  </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll ring it for you - I'll just get my phone... out... of... my pocket... Oh, this is your phone! You <strong>put </strong>it on my desk by mistake... So, where have I <strong>put</strong> my phone? I always <strong>put</strong> it in my pocket...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So we asked you: How many times has Abdullah rung this week?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: five. He's <strong>rung</strong> five times this week. </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Ring... rang... rung</strong>. So, the past simple of <strong>ring</strong> is <strong>rang</strong>, and the past participle is <strong>rung</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There are several irregular verbs like <strong>ring</strong>, with different forms for the base verb, past simple and past participle.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The verb <strong>take</strong>, for example, which we had earlier. Listen out for it in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I haven't <strong>taken </strong>it. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I didn't <strong>say</strong> you <strong>'took'</strong> it. I just <strong>said</strong> 'Have you <strong>seen</strong> it?'</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I <strong>saw</strong> it on your desk this morning.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I can't <strong>see</strong> it here!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So the verb <strong>take</strong> changes to <strong>took</strong> in the past simple...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...and <strong>taken</strong> in the past participle.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We also heard <strong>see, saw </strong>and<strong> seen.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...three different forms again. <strong>See</strong> is the main verb, <strong>saw</strong> is the past simple...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...and <strong>seen</strong> is the past participle.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Other verbs that follow this pattern are <strong>write, wrote, written</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...<strong>break, broke, broken</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...<strong>speak, spoke, spoken</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...and <strong>choose, chose, chosen</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Good. Now, in the clip we also heard <strong>say</strong> and <strong>said.</strong> The verb <strong>say </strong>belongs to a different group of irregular verbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, verbs in this group have just two different forms. For example, with <strong>say, said, said,</strong> the past simple and the past participle are the same.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Other verbs in this second group are: </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Tell, told, told; have</strong>, <strong>had</strong>, <strong>had; lose</strong>, <strong>lost</strong>, <strong>lost</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>...<strong>meet, met,</strong> <strong>met; find, found, found</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Very good. Now, in the third group of irregular verbs we are looking at today, all three forms are the same. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Listen to this clip and see if you can spot an example.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<strong><br/></strong></span></strong><span><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Oh, this is your phone. You <strong>put </strong>it on my desk by mistake... So, where have I <strong>put</strong> my phone? I always <strong>put</strong> it in my pocket...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>put, put, put -</strong> all three forms are exactly the same.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Other verbs in this group include <strong>cut, cut, cut; let, let, let</strong> and <strong>shut, shut, shut</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>You’re listening to bbclearningenglish.com </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we're talking about three different groups of irregular verbs. In one group, the verb is the same in all three forms, like <strong>put</strong>, <strong>put</strong>,<strong> put</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In another group the verb is the same in two of its forms, like <strong>say, said, said</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...and in the third, and biggest group, all three forms are different, like <strong>take, took, taken</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And now, it's quiz time! Question one. What are the three forms of the verb <strong>shut</strong> – as in <strong>shut the door</strong>?  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is<strong> shut, shut, shut.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Number two. What are the three forms of the verb <strong>find</strong> - as in <strong>find some money</strong>?  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is<strong> find, found, found</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And number three: Which of these verbs is different in all three forms: a) <strong>have</strong>, b) <strong>choose</strong> or c) <strong>let</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And the answer is b) choose, chose, chosen. The others are a) <strong>have, had, had</strong> and c) is <strong>let, let, let</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And that's the end of the quiz, quiz, quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And now, today's top tip, tip, tip for learning vocabulary: most good grammar books and websites have verb tables.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Verbs, verbs, verbs</h3>\n<p>In this programme we look at the difficult subject of irregular verbs: verbs that don't behave normally. Unfortunately, not all verbs take <strong>-ed </strong>in the past and perfect tenses. For example, look at what happens to the verb <strong>choose </strong>in the past simple and present perfect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I <strong>chose</strong> a black dress last time (past simple)</li>\n<li>I've <strong>chosen</strong> a black dress again (present perfect)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Note: Past participle</h3>\n<p>In the last sentence, the word <strong>chosen</strong> is what we call the <strong>past participle</strong>. The past participle is used in the present perfect (I have chosen), the past perfect (I had chosen), passives (it is chosen) and adjectives (the chosen one).</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to this episode of 6 Minute Vocabulary. In the programme, Mike says his phone is missing. But who <strong>took</strong> it? Mike thinks Neil has <strong>taken</strong> it. Is Mike right?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-12/downloads\">Unit 12 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9xz/episodes/downloads\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>So, it <em>was</em> Neil who <strong>took</strong> Mike's phone. But it was an accident, so we'll forgive him! Have a look at the grammar notes. We'll do some practice on the next activity page.</p>\n<h3>Verbs with three different forms</h3>\n<p><strong>Take</strong> is an irregular verb which has <strong>three</strong> different forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infinitive = <strong>take</strong></li>\n<li>past simple = <strong>took</strong></li>\n<li>past participle = <strong>taken</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can refer to the forms as: <strong>take, took, taken</strong>. Other verbs which follow this pattern include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>break, broke, broken</strong></li>\n<li><strong>choose, chose, chosen</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ring, rang, rung</strong></li>\n<li><strong>see, saw, seen</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Verbs with <strong>two</strong> different forms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>find, found, found</strong></li>\n<li><strong>have, had, had</strong></li>\n<li><strong>lose, lost, lost</strong></li>\n<li><strong>meet, met, met</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Verbs with only one form</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>cut, cut, cut</strong></li>\n<li><strong>let, let, let</strong></li>\n<li><strong>put, put, put</strong></li>\n<li><strong>shut, shut, shut</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Now it's time to see how much you remember about these three categories of irregular verbs, as we do an activity to test your general understanding.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Quiz time</h3>\n<p>In Activity 1 we looked at irregular verbs with different numbers of forms. In this activity and the next one, we're going to do two tests. The first one checks your general understanding of these irregular verbs, and in the second one you're going to use them in a conversation.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Try this activity to see how much you understand about these irregular verbs.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Good job! But there's still one more test to do. Can you use these irregular verbs correctly in a conversation?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Do you know the correct form?</h3>\n<p>Let's do one more activity. In this one we'll test how well you know the different forms of these irregular verbs, by taking part in a conversation that has lots of examples of them.</p>\n<p>Imagine you've just got back from a lovely holiday and you're telling your very patient friend all about it. You're looking through all the <strong>snaps</strong> (photographs) you took.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Complete the conversation with the correct forms of these verbs. Do you need the infinitive, the past simple, or the past participle form? And which is which? If you really need to, have a look at the grammar area on this page.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Well done, you've reached the end of this session. Remember you are one of millions of people studying English. That's right, English <strong>is studied</strong> all around the world. <strong>Is studied</strong> is an example of the passive voice. You'll be learning all about it in the next session. Join us there!</p></div>",

And in today's programme we're talking about… Oww! You hit me! Catherine! That hurt! </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>   <br/></strong></span><span>Yes, Finn, I hit you.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>I hope there's a grammatical reason for that!</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Always, Finn. I wouldn't hit you without a good reason. And the reason is, we're talking about active and passive voice today. And in the active voice we say <strong>Catherine hit Finn</strong>: subject - verb - object. Like this:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>Oww! You hit me again!!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>All in the name of grammar.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>OK. <strong>You hit me</strong>. Subject - verb – object. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>That's right. So, speaking grammatically, the subject – that's me – performs or does the action… </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>And the object of the verb – that’s me - receives or gets the action. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Another one?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>No. Catherine hit Finn. But of course I'm more important than you Catherine, so I want to be at the beginning of the sentence. Let's say it this way: Finn was hit by Catherine. Don't do it again.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Ok - Finn was hit by Catherine. We put the receiver of the verb at the beginning of the </span><span>sentence, plus the verb <strong>to be</strong> and the past participle, to make a passive sentence: Finn was </span><span>hit by Catherine. So here's Rob with some examples of active and passive sentences. </span><span>First an active sentence:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob     <br/></span></strong><span>Millions of people use the internet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>And with the receiver of the verb at the beginning of the sentence – in the passive voice.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/></strong></span><span>The internet is used by millions of people.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Active:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>A thief stole my car.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Passive:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob <br/></span></strong><span>My car was stolen by a thief.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Active:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Somebody rescued the child.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Passive:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The child was rescued by somebody.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>    <br/></span><span>Thanks Rob. And now that Catherine has stopped hitting me, we can look at that last pair of sentences more closely. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>OK.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>Thank you. Right, in many situations, the passive sentence <strong>the child was rescued</strong> would sound more natural than <strong>somebody rescued the child</strong> - now, that's if we feel the child is more important than the rescuer. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Yes - and we don't know who rescued the child, so we don't need to say <strong>by somebody</strong>. It's just: <strong>The child was rescued</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>That's right - if you don't know who or what is doing the verb, or if it's not important, or if </span><span>it's obvious, you can leave it out completely, like this:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong>     <br/></span><span>My car was stolen.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>Let's have another sentence in active voice:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob     <br/></span></strong><strong><span>The storm destroyed the bridge</span></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>And here it is in passive voice:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob     <br/></span></strong><strong><span>The bridge was destroyed by the storm</span></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>Here, the subject - the storm - is important, so we don't leave it out.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT           <br/></span></strong><span>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>And we're talking about active and passive voice.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>That's right. When the thing receiving the action of the verb is important, you can show this </span><span>importance, by putting it at the start of the sentence, and using the verb <strong>to be</strong> plus the past </span><span>participle of the verb to make a passive form.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>And if the person or thing doing the verb is obvious, unimportant or unknown, you can </span><span>leave it out.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>Now for our quiz. Which of these news headlines sounds better: is it a):</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>85-year-old Mary Hiker has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn   <br/></span></strong><span>Or b):</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Mount Kilimanjaro has been climbed by an 85-year-old, Mary Hiker.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Well, they are grammatically correct, but the active sentence a) is the best - if you agree that the name and age of the climber is more important than the name of the mountain she climbed! </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>85-year-old Mary Hiker has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>Next up - option a):</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob <br/></span></strong><span>The police arrested the burglars and took them to the police station.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>And option b):</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The burglars were arrested and taken to the police station. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>And the passive in option b) is best - we can guess that the police arrested the burglars, so we don't need to mention them.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/></strong></span><span>The burglars were arrested and taken to the police station. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>    <br/></span><span>And the last one - option a):</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>William posted a photo of his birthday party on his webpage. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>And option b):</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>A photo of William's birthday party was posted by him on his webpage.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>And option a) sounds much better - because William is most definitely the subject of this sentence!</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>William posted a photo of his birthday party on his webpage.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Now, here's a tip for using the passive voice in spoken English. You may hear people use the verb <strong>get</strong> instead of the verb <strong>be</strong>, like this:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Your bike will <strong>get stolen</strong> if you don't lock it!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>Right. And if you hit your colleagues, Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>If you hit your colleagues for a non-grammatical reason, Finn, you will get into trouble.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn    <br/></span></strong><span>OK, thank you very much, and there we are: the passive voice is made with an object, plus the verb to be, plus the past participle.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>And we use it when we're more interested in the object of a verb, or if the subject is </span><span>unknown or obvious.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>    <br/>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A simple sentence in English is formed of <strong>subject + verb + object</strong>.</p>\n<p>Someone does something, for example:</p>\n<p><em>Millions of people use the internet.<br/></em><em>Susie planted a pine tree.</em><br/> <em>Someone has stolen my bike.</em></p>\n<p>These sentences are in what is called the <strong>active voice</strong>. The speaker is focusing on the person or thing that did the action described by the verb. The person or thing that does the action described by the verb is also known as the <strong>agent</strong>.</p>\n<p>So what is the <strong>passive voice</strong>?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Sometimes we are more interested in the person or thing affected by the main verb. In these cases we use the <strong>passive voice</strong> and the structure of the sentence changes.</p>\n<p>Here are the same sentences again using the passive:</p>\n<p><em>The internet is used by millions of people. </em><br/><em>A pine tree was planted by Susie. </em><br/><em>My bike has been stolen by someone.</em></p>\n<p>The passive is often used in situations when the person or thing doing the verb is unknown, unimportant or obvious. In these cases the agent can be left out.</p>\n<p>Take the example of the bike that was stolen. The owner doesn’t know who stole it. What is important to him or her is the bike, and that fact that it has gone:</p>\n<p><em>My bike has been stolen!</em></p>\n<p>Here are some other examples where the agent can be left out:</p>\n<p><em>The liquid was heated to 100 degrees. </em>(It is the process that is important, not the agent.) <br/><em>The president was voted into office. </em>(The agent is obvious.)</p>\n<h3>How to make the passive</h3>\n<p><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<p>The passive voice is made with <strong>subject + to be + past participle (+ by + object)</strong></p>\n<p>In the passive the main verb always has the past participle form. The verb <strong>to be</strong> changes to reflect the tense/verb form that is needed, for example the present perfect or the simple future:</p>\n<p><em>Honey <strong>is made</strong> by bees.<br/>My car <strong>has been repaired</strong>.<br/> The winner <strong>will be announced</strong> at the end of the competition.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<p>A negative passive sentence is formed with <strong>subject + negative of to be + past participle (+ by + object)</strong></p>\n<p><em>My car <strong>is not being repaired</strong> by our usual mechanic.<br/> Honey <strong>is not made</strong> by wasps.<br/> The winner <strong>will not be announced</strong> until the results have been double-checked.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong><em>Is</em></strong><em> our car <strong>being</strong> <strong>repaired</strong> by our usual mechanic?<strong><br/> Is</strong> honey <strong>made</strong> by bees?<br/> When <strong>will</strong> the winner <strong>be</strong> <strong>announced</strong>?</em></em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Can you identify active and passive sentences? In this activity put each sentence into the correct column, active or passive.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Good! Next we take a closer look at the passive and its use in spoken English.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Active or passive?</h3>\n<p>So how do you choose whether to use the active or passive voice? In fact, it's not a grammatical choice, it's usually one of style and emphasis.</p>\n<p>Look at these two sentences:</p>\n<p><em>The passive is used to describe processes. (</em><strong><em>Passive</em></strong><em>)</em></p>\n<p><em>We use the passive to describe processes. (</em><strong><em>Active</em></strong><em>)</em></p>\n<p>They are both grammatically correct and they both mean the same. In this case the passive is more formal and the active is more direct and friendly. Which one you choose depends on what you're saying, and to whom.</p>\n<p>In formal descriptive writing, for example when talking about manufacturing or scientific processes, using the passive is common:</p>\n<p><em>The metal sheeting </em><strong><em>is </em></strong><strong><em>heated</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>bent</em></strong><em> into shape before </em><strong><em>being cooled, </em></strong><strong><em>polished</em></strong><em> and finally </em><strong><em>painted.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Another time we use it is when reporting meetings and discussions:</p>\n<p><em>The decision </em><strong><em>was taken</em></strong><em> to reduce the size of the workforce in order to save money.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Spoken English</h3>\n<p><strong>Get</strong> is sometimes used in place of the verb <strong>to be</strong> in the passive. This is especially common in informal, spoken English.</p>\n<p><em>I <strong>got fired</strong> for being late!</em><br><em>These letters <strong>get delivered</strong> first.</em><br/><em>Your bike will <strong>get stolen</strong> if you don’t lock it up.</em></br></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the following paragraph. It contains a number of examples of <strong>active </strong>forms. In the activity you will need to rewrite the active phrases to make them passive.</p>\n<p><em>Police found a seriously <strong>injured</strong> man early this morning on Sandy Beach. Someone <strong>informed</strong> the police at around 5am. Officers arrived on the scene shortly after. <strong>Paramedics</strong> took the man to the local hospital but doctors <strong>pronounced</strong> him <strong>dead on arrival</strong>. The police do not yet know the <strong>cause of death</strong>. They are questioning local residents for information.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Time now to head to the next page to listen to Catherine and Finn in 6 Minute Grammar.

Some people spend a fortune on them - even getting into debt to get their hands on (or their feet into) the latest pair of designer shoes. But when it comes to high-heeled shoes, the true cost might affect your health as well as your bank account. Take a look at our article. While you read, look out for the answer to this question:</p>\n<p><strong>Who were the first high-heeled shoes</strong> <strong>made for?</strong></p>\n<p>We'll bring you some more questions about the article later on. Happy reading!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and do the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>How high is too high?</h3>\n<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>Many people believe high heels make women look good. So much so, it seems, that the organisers of the Cannes Film Festival reportedly barred women in flat shoes from walking the red carpet. But all this <strong>glam</strong> comes at a cost: wearing heels over 10cm high can damage your ankles.</br></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>A study by Hanseo University in South Korea suggests that continuous wearing exposes women to the risk of <strong>strains</strong>, and makes them <strong>prone to</strong> losing their balance. A total of 40 women who wear high heels at least three times a week took part in the study. The strength of their ankles was measured regularly: researchers found that two of the four main muscles became <strong>dominant</strong> after a period of between one and three years. This created an imbalance in their feet.</p>\n<p>Dr Yong-Seok Jee from Hanseo University said that the habit of wearing heels can result in <strong>deformed</strong> feet, back pain and unhealthy walking patterns. He recommends that women limit the use of these kinds of shoes and exercise their ankle muscles properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>High heels are considered by some people to be sexy and feminine, but in fact the fashion started with men's feet. These shoes were a form of riding footwear, and were seen on the feet of 17th Century Persian soldiers. Elizabeth Semmelhack of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto says: \"When the soldier stood up in his <strong>stirrups</strong>, the heel helped him to secure his <strong>stance</strong> so that he could shoot his bow and arrow more effectively.\"</p>\n<p>Before becoming a <strong>staple</strong> of modern women's wardrobes, high heels were used by Louis XIV of France. These shoes were status symbols. Let's face it – nothing screams privilege like uncomfortable, luxurious and impractical clothing. They say the wearer doesn't have to work in fields or walk very far.</p>\n<p>What do you think: are high heels a symbol of women's <strong>elevation</strong> in society - or should they be booted out of fashion?</p>\n<p>This article was based on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21151350\">BBC News story</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>The answer to our question:</strong></h3>\n<p>We asked you: <strong>Who were the first high-heeled shoes made for?</strong> The answer is: <strong>They were made for men: they were worn by Persian soldiers in the 17th Century. </strong>Now check your understanding of the rest of the article with our quiz... </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed that article.

We give old clothes to the needy people, charity, servants, etc.</p>\n<p>2. We also use such clothes for household work like in cleaning ans washing.</p>\n<p>3. Sometimes these are thrown in the bin.</p>\n<p>4. Some people sell these clothes in exchange of useful things to the people who are involved in such activities.</p>\n<p>5. People sell their clothes online too if these are in good condition and belong to a well known brand.</p>\n<p>6. In above condition, these wearable clothes also can be exchanged with new garments if the store of that particular brand announces this facility</p>\n<p>7. Lastly, of course, few clothes are kept ever and ever as mentioned already in the site as a pert of memories.</p>\n<h3>Nadia, France</h3>\n<p>In France, unwanted clothes end up in charity shops like Emmaius or in second-hand trade.</p>\n<p>I noticed that Emmaius shops are mainly located in cities and not in the countrysides.</p>\n<p>Same thing than in the UK, there are also textile banks.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I recycle my clothes to make dolls in textile or to decorate boxes of tidying or frames.</p>\n<p>Off and on I get rit it in textile banks.</p>\n<p>There are people who like keeping clothes in souvenirs but so far, I'm not in this scheme.</p>\n<h3>Ewa, Poland</h3>\n<p>In my country unwanted garments are collected in many ways: directly from the door, through charity organisations, through textile banks. I prefer the last way of clothes collection because it creates workplace for many people.</p>\n<p>There are also another way to get rid of your old clothes: you can swap them with another person at exchange events. Et in the end you are the recipient of something new and some your clothes are given to somebody else. This sort of swap seems to be very ecological and economical enough.</p>\n<h3>Lineda, France</h3>\n<p>In my country I can get rid of unwanted clothes one way or another.</p>\n<p>Twice a year Charities send big bags, people put their old clothes and the bags are collected by the organisation few days later.</p>\n<p>I also recycle them as I do with the paper, the glass bottles in large recycled bins.</p>\n<p>I also give my clothes in good condition to my relatives such as my cousins my best friends.</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping them in our wardrobes I sort out them once or twice a year in order to make room and to buy others clothes to be fashionably dressed.</p>\n<h3>Robson, Brazil</h3>\n<p>In my country people donate unwanted clothes for charities, like in UK.</p>\n<p>Charities are controlled by churches and nonprofits that are responsible for organizing the donated and choosing poor families that will receive them.</p>\n<p>This job is so importante because in Brazil there are a lot of poor families with little child that needs old clothes, especially in the winter season. </p>\n<h3>Ngọc Linh</h3>\n<p>My mother told me that when I was under the age of one month old, I wore second hand clothes that had been used for another healthy infant. People believed that using those clothes would help scare away ghosts from babies, so they could grow up faster and healthier. Another reason might be scarcity. These days, parents don't do that any more because the standard of living has been improved. They can afford to buy new garments for their baby. My mom is not a cheapskate but she does use old clothes instead of buying new rugs or hand-wipes. I don't like her to do this because it makes my house look like a mess. Sometimes, I give my unwanted clothes to charities, but if they are souvenirs, I never throw them away.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>Well, in my country the unwanted clothes have different uses. the most important is the recycle. This task is executed by humble people that try to win a bit of money with the sales of those articles. They  walk for the different streets of my city and try to collect the garments in good state door by door or sometimes they have to  pass before the garbage lorry arrives, when is garbage collection day.</p>\n<p>They sometimes change this clothes by other things (this action is known as barter).</p>\n<p>When nobody passes to collect the second-hand clothes some churches make charity campaigns for the poor people of community.</p>\n<p>In my country we have too stores that imported second-hand clothes to retail. I think that some clothes could  be yours.</p>\n<h3>Joaquim</h3>\n<p>Description of what happens to unwanted clothes in my country: </p>\n<p>There are non-profit associations that make agreements with municipalities for the installation containers in cities. After that the clothes may take different paths:</p>\n<p>The materials are sent to their recycling centers and classified according to their characteristics. From there, they can follow three paths: sold in stores, sent for recycling or landfilled.</p>\n<h3>Francisco, Spain</h3>\n<p>Here, in some cities you can find containers where you can throw your old clothes whilst in the villages old clothes are  collected door to door by retailers. They stick a note  in your front door announcing the day they will pick up the bags with your old clothes.</p>\n<p>In addition old clothes are usually given to charities by people who want to give help to other needy people.</p>\n<p>Finally you can keep some of your old clothes and wear them for house painting jobs, gardening, tiding up stuff, etc.</p>\n<h3>Truong Uyên, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>In my country, Vietnam, volunteers are a people who collect old clothes (they are studying in university and join a organization which is call HoChiMinh Communist Youth Union).</p>\n<p>After collect clothes from many source like: family, university, school (1st, secondary, high school)... They start to sort the garments by quality and type. Then they will go to the SOS-Kinderdorf, pagoda and many place where its have orphan kids and give it to them. </p>\n<h3>Anastasiya</h3>\n<p>The best way to have no problem with unwanted clothes is to buy only garments you are really need. My children have a lot of clothing and they grow up very quickly. So I pack their small clothes and give them to a friend of mine. She works as a volunteer in a charities and she take clothing, toys, footwear to orphan children and to families who have many children and are short of money. Charity hasn't any sorting plants at all. Clothing is sorting by some volunteers in my friend's garage or in someone's shed. I must say, they deliver garments to recipients all by themselves. Clothing isn't recycled in my country.</p>\n<p>There are some second-hand shops in my town. Garments from the UK and Europe are retailed there. But Russian and Chinese unwanted clothes aren't taken for sales. They say they are in no condition to sell and wear these clothing again. I know some people, who can spend loads of money to buy clothing in mass-market shops. But they prefer buying second-hand ones from abroad. They suggest, that garments, which were shipped overseas, have better quality and more practical.   </p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>In Italy, around the streets, there are big white containers where you can put your no longer used clothes in. As second-hand clothes make up a lucrative business, sometimes these containers either fall prey to thieves or are run by company linked to criminal organisations. If you want to be sure that your old clothes are delivered to people in need, a good alternative is to take them to the neighbourhood church. Fortunately, in Italy we have as many churches as white containers.</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I don't know what happens to unwanted clothes in my country. Maybe someone sells on market, gives for charities and so on. But I think that our country likely is a recipient country 'cause here many people buy clothes which were brought from wealthier countries at second-hand shops. To buy new garments expensively here and often second-hand clothing have a better quality than new ones and their cost is significantly lower. Sometimes may buy almost for nothing brand things.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Juan, Spain</h3>\n<p>In the last decades people get much more clothes than years ago. It seems to be true we are installed in the consumerism era, at least in the Western world or Occident. Consumers are extended all over the developed world.</p>\n<p>It would be difficult to keep such an amount of garment at home being the dwellings small as they usually are. So people give the unwanted clothes to charities or recycle them when they are modified into a new style or fashion.</p>\n<p>This second option is extended by crisis' periods which may be a positive aspect if consumerism is reduced significantly.</p>\n<h3>Marie, Quebec, Canada</h3>\n<p>With friends, we organize an \"ladies' night\". Our garments are exchanged  for free of charge. What is unwanted can be desired by another. Of course, we have to be on the same size. Also, nice fabrics are picked up to be remodeled by myself. I like to sew and transform textile into a second life. Creation is very good against mental illness. Unwanted clothes at the end of the party are donated to a local Charity what helps people in our city. For a dollar or two, they can be dressed properly and be proud. My best friend's father is in charge of this organization for years. Helping people makes him very busy and happy.</p>\n<h3>Angelika, Germany</h3>\n<p>What happens to unwanted cloth in Germany?</p>\n<p>Generally we have the same procedure as in the UK. Cloth that someone wants to get rid of can be put into textile banks on the streets or you leave the unwanted garments in the hands of collectors.</p>\n<p>Our citizens are being informed by companies or charity organizations about the dates of collections in advance and where the cloth will get collected.</p>\n<p>But children's cloth is often exchanged by young parents on especially organized events. So they come together and do not only exchange their children's cloth but also experience where special clothing can be bought for little money. </p>\n<p>Such kind of \"reuse\" is very common and I appreciate it. That is a way to avoid profit for merchants overseas. Young parents as well as their children here in our region get advantage of this useful habit. The sellers and the recipients meet each other and sometimes they become even friends.</p>\n<h3>Franco, Argentina</h3>\n<p>In Argentina,  the clothes that is not use, the people give at the church for the poor peoples and the homeless. anybody throw to garbage. In the church, the clothes is sorts by types and quality similar to England. this clothes is takes to other provinces in special to Argentine northerm for example Salta and Jujuy provinces.</p>\n<h3>Dzung, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>Well, talk about unwanted clothes. </p>\n<p>Most of citizen have many unwanted clothes. </p>\n<p>Some try to sell it on the internet through facebook, twitter, webs...</p>\n<p>They'll get some money to buy new clothes or other favourite things.</p>\n<p>Another gather unwanted clothes to poverty people. They often congregate together in a similar place to package its into bales and put its on the car or truck and drive to the poor areas. They'll distribute them to the poor children and their family. Students and other kindhearted people will collect unwanted clothes from people who don't use it any more.</p>\n<p>Many people have unwanted clothes but they don't know how to do with it. They don't want to keep it any more. In other hand, they have no idea about charities address or phone numbers to contract to them collect it.</p>\n<p>There're also some people who will keep unwanted clothes for ever and ever. I thought they don't want to share it to other. And maybe they have their reason to do it.</p>\n<h3>Yoko, Japan</h3>\n<p>Few years ago, one book become a best seller which explain how to get away unwanted goods.In that books, we are not happy when we live with unwanted goods, so we have to get away them as soon as possible with feeling of thanks. There are a few recycle shop in Japan, so maybe many Japanese do away with clothes to dust box.</p>\n<h3>TJ, Taiwan</h3>\n<p>Most of my old clothes are put into textile banks because they are near my home, and it's more convenient than carry them to other places.</p>\n<p>But I really don't know the process proceed or how do they transfer. I never concern or pay attention to it.</p>\n<p>Besides this way, some of my garments that I can't wear anymore are given for my relatives.</p>\n<p>It's a good way to save money because children are growing quickly.</p>\n<p>The last I use unwanted clothes as wiper.</p>\n<p>When they become this, they should be dirty or has patches that can't give to anyone.</p>\n<h3>Geneviève, France</h3>\n<p>Last month, I decided to sort my clothes. It was very difficult because I have a problem in supressing something: each cloth seemed me still useful. At the end I put a little garment in a bag and carried them to a textile bank. It's the same travel from France for the old clothes that in England. But I saw on TV that a lot of these clothes arriving in the recipient country aren't  usable so they are rotting there after a very long way. I had been very disapointed with that information.</p>\n<h3>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</h3>\n<p>In my country, we usually give the old clothes to charity. Or, sometimes we organise a bazaar to sell them. Many people enjoy going to a bazaar because we can find very cheap good garments.  </p>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's all for this unit. We hope you enjoyed learning about the journeys that old clothes make. In Session 5 we're going back to Victorian England again for part 2 of our drama <strong>The Importance of Being Earnest</strong>. This time, we learn the secret behind Ernest's identity, and there is a marriage proposal!</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about words like <strong>someone</strong>,<strong> nothing </strong>and<strong> anywhere</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, let's start by listening to Tracey. She's talking to a friend about a problem she has.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And here's a question for you: What is Tracey worried about? Here she is.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Tracey<br/></strong>My boyfriend seems to be very busy these days. I'm worried there’s <strong>someone</strong> else in his life. I mean, most evenings he could be <strong>anywhere</strong> for all I know. He always says that he couldn't love <strong>anyone</strong> except me. And <strong>everyone</strong> knows that you should trust people you love. But do you think I should say <strong>something</strong> to him? There's <strong>no one</strong> else I can ask.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So that's Tracey. And we asked you: What is Tracey worried about?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And the answer is: She's worried that there's <strong>someone</strong> else in her boyfriend's life.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh yes. Now <strong>someone</strong> is one of the words we're looking at today. <strong>Someone</strong> means <strong>one person</strong> but it doesn’t say who.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, Tracey doesn't know who it might be. And <strong>someone </strong>often goes with the word<strong> else</strong>.<strong> Someone else </strong>means one other person.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And Tracey used other words with <strong>one</strong> in them. Listen for them in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>He always says that he couldn't love <strong>anyone</strong> except me. And <strong>everyone</strong> knows that you should trust people you love... There’s <strong>no one</strong> else I can ask.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine.<br/></strong>Right, so there's <strong>anyone</strong>. That also means one person, but <strong>anyone</strong> is used mostly in questions and negative sentences.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Then there's <strong>everyone</strong>: <strong>Everyone</strong> means all people.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And <strong>no one</strong>. There's no one else I can ask. Notice the word <strong>else</strong> again,. <strong>No one else</strong> means <strong>no other person</strong>. You can also say <strong>anyone else. </strong> Or <strong>everyone else</strong>. That means <strong>all other people</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, in written English,<strong> someone</strong>,<strong> anyone </strong>and<strong> everyone </strong>are all one word but <strong>no one </strong>is two words: <strong>no</strong> and <strong>one.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. And <strong>somebody</strong>,<strong> anybody</strong>,<strong> everybody</strong> and <strong>nobody</strong> are used in exactly the same way as <strong>someone</strong>, <strong>anyone</strong> and the others. But <strong>nobody</strong> is one word. So that's different from <strong>no one</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong>But do you think I should say <strong>something</strong> to him?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So this time we heard <strong>something</strong>. And of course we can also have <strong>anything</strong>,<strong> everything </strong>and <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And something means:<strong> one thing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Anything </strong>and<strong> everything </strong>mean<strong> all things</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And<strong> nothing </strong>means -<strong> no thing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now let's look at the verbs we use with all these words. Tracey said: <strong>there's someone else</strong> and <strong>everyone knows</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She did. The interesting thing here is that they're singular verbs: <strong>is</strong> and <strong>knows</strong>. We always always use a singular verb with these words. And what about the verb with <strong>no one</strong> and <strong>nothing</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Like in the sentence:<strong> There's no one else I can ask…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right, it's a singular verb again. We say <strong>there is</strong> not <strong>there are</strong>. And notice that it's positive. It’s a common mistake to use a negative verb with the <strong>no</strong> words. So we don’t say 'no one isn’t going'.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We say <strong>no one is going</strong>. And there’s an important point to make about <strong>everyone</strong> and <strong>everybody</strong>. Even though the verb is singular, we use <strong>they</strong>,<strong> their</strong> and <strong>them</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So: <strong>Everyone says they will come to the party</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with <strong>no one</strong> and <strong>nobody</strong>.<strong> Nobody wants to know their exam results</strong>! And now for the last clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong>I mean, most evenings he could be <strong>anywhere</strong> for all I know. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now usually<strong> anywhere, anyone or anything, </strong>mean one place, person or thing. For example <strong>Is there anywhere to park the car?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But here<strong> anywhere </strong>means<strong> in any place</strong>, <strong>it doesn't matter where exactly</strong>. And you can use <strong>anyone</strong> or <strong>anything</strong> in the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>ask anyone</strong> means <strong>it doesn't matter who you ask</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And <strong>I'll eat anything</strong> means <strong>it doesn't matter what I eat</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right, it's quiz time! Here’s number one: Which is correct? a) Anyone knows that London is the capital of the UK. Or b) Everyone knows that London is the capital of the UK.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's b).</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>That's the one! Number two: a) Are you inviting anyone other? b) Are you inviting anyone else?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's b) again.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And now number three: a) Everyone put their coats on and left. b) Everyone put on his coat and left. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it’s a).</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Very good! Well done if you got all of those right.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. We often use <strong>someone, anyone, everyone</strong> and <strong>no one</strong> before adjectives and infinitives. So <strong>Is there anything nice to eat</strong>? Or <strong>there’s nothing to eat</strong>. Try making other sentences like that with these words and write them in your notebook.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span> <br/></span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>Today we're talking about comparatives and superlatives. So, let's start with comparatives. We use them to compare one thing or person with another. Catherine, how was your journey to work this morning?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>Ok. Well, my journey to work wasn't great, actually. I woke up later than usual, so I took the bus because it's quicker than walking. And it's easier than cycling, too. But the traffic was much busier than normal and we went slower and slower and people became more and more impatient. And the slower the bus went, the more impatient the people became.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>You poor thing. But, lots of comparatives there in your story - we had <strong>later</strong> and <strong>quicker</strong>: Catherine woke up <strong>later</strong> than usual, and she said the bus is <strong>quicker</strong> than walking.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>I did. And to make the comparative form of short adjectives or adverbs, we just add the letters <strong>-</strong><strong>e-r</strong>. So, <strong>quick</strong>, <strong>quicker</strong>. But if the word already ends in <strong>-e</strong>, we just add the letter <strong>-r</strong>. <strong>Late</strong>, <strong>later</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Remember that we often use the word <strong>than</strong> in comparative sentences, but sometimes we can leave it out, for example in the question <strong>Which is quicker – the bus or the train?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>I also said that the bus is <strong>easier than cycling</strong> and <strong>the traffic was much busier than normal</strong>. For adjectives and adverbs that end in the letter <strong>-y</strong> and the sound <strong>ee</strong>, make comparatives by losing the letter <strong>-y</strong> and adding the letters <strong>-i-e-r</strong>. So the comparative of <strong>easy </strong>is <strong>easier</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And <strong>busy</strong> becomes <strong>busier</strong>. In fact, Catherine said the traffic was <strong>much</strong> busier. Now, we can use <strong>much</strong> or <strong>a lot</strong> before an adjective or adverb to emphasise the difference. <strong>Much busier; a lot easier</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>To make comparative forms of most adjectives and adverbs with two or more syllables, we use <strong>more</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>For example,<strong> impatient</strong> has three syllables: <strong>im-pa-tient</strong>, so the comparative of <strong>impatient</strong> is <strong>more impatient</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That’s right and to emphasise how something changes, we can repeat comparatives, or the word <strong>more</strong> with <strong>and</strong> in the middle, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>The bus went<strong> slower and slower </strong>and people became<strong> more and more impatient</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Don't remind me. Here’s another way to use comparatives. Listen to this sentence: <strong>the slower the bus went, the more impatient the people became</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>I'm not surprised. Here Catherine used two different comparatives - <strong>slower</strong> and <strong>more impatient</strong> - with <strong>the</strong>, to say how one thing changes when something else changes. <strong>The slower the bus went</strong>, <strong>the more impatient the people became</strong>. Really not a good morning, was it, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Not at all. And it got <strong>worse</strong> when the bus broke down! </p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Oh really? Oh no, but perfect for us because<strong> worse</strong> is the comparative adjective of bad. It is irregular. The comparative adverb is <strong>badly</strong>. Catherine’s morning went <strong>badly</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Very badly. And the comparative of both <strong>good</strong> and <strong>well</strong> is also irregular: it's <strong>better</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And we're talking about comparatives and superlatives.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Let's look at superlative adjectives and adverbs. They help us compare one person or thing with <strong>several</strong> others. So Catherine, what is <strong>the quickest</strong> way for you to get to work?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Well, usually the bus is <strong>the quickest</strong>, but not today. But walking is <strong>the most reliable</strong> way and it’s also <strong>the easiest</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>OK, we make superlatives in a similar way to comparatives…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>… but the ending for short words is <strong>-e-s-t</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So <strong>quick</strong> becomes <strong>the</strong> <strong>quickest</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>… and we use <strong>most</strong> for words with two or more syllables.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So the superlative of <strong>reliable</strong> is <strong>the</strong> <strong>most reliable</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's right. For two-syllable words ending in the letter <strong>-y,</strong> change the <strong>y</strong> to<strong> i</strong> and add <strong>-e-s-t</strong>, so <strong>easy</strong> becomes <strong>the easiest</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Don't forget to put <strong>the</strong> before a superlative adjective or adverb, so it's: walking is <strong>the best</strong> way to get to work…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>… though we can use possessive adjectives instead of the word <strong>the</strong>, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>My best</strong> friend is getting married today.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And did you spot the irregular superlative - <strong>best</strong>? This is the superlative form of <strong>good </strong>and<strong> well</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>… and the irregular superlative of <strong>bad</strong> is <strong>worst</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Now for the quiz. Which is correct? a) Your internet connection is faster than mine or b) Your internet connection is fastest than mine.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>It's a).</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Good. And the last one, a) I hope I have a better journey home tonight or b) I hope I have a best journey home tonight.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Well, it’s a). And we do hope you have a much better journey home tonight, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong>Bye.</p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Not everything in life is the same, thank goodness. Difference makes life interesting: it gives us choices and things to talk about.</p>\n<p>When things are different, we can compare them. We can compare just about everything in life, from the price and size of objects to the degree of emotions such as love and happiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjectives</strong> and <strong>adverbs</strong> help us to describe things; we use <strong>comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs</strong> to compare one person or thing with another person or thing.</p>\n<p><em>Today is <strong>hotter</strong> <strong>than</strong> yesterday.<br/></em><em>I think documentaries are <strong>more interesting than</strong> the news.<br/></em><em>I'm feeling sick. Can you drive a bit <strong>slower?</strong><br/>This is the <strong>best</strong> meal I've had in ages.<br/>She said maths was the <strong>most difficult</strong> exam she had taken this year.</em></p>\n<p>Before we look at comparatives and superlatives in more detail, try this quiz to remind you of the basics.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Using the picture above as a guide, rearrange the words in each question to make a correct sentence.</p>\n<p>Here's some vocabulary you might find useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Fur-lined boots - </strong>boots that have a soft fur inside to keep you warm and comfortable. In the picture there is a pair of fur-lined boots in the middle.</p>\n<p><strong>Lace-up shoes - </strong>shoes that have laces which you tie to keep them on. In the picture there is a pair of lace-up shoes on the right.</p>\n<p>Now enjoy the quiz, oh and to make it more of a challenge, in each question there are three words you don't need!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>That was fun - how did you do? Now you've refreshed your memory of the basics of comparatives and superlatives, let's look at them in a bit more detail.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Highlighting change</h3>\n<p>It's a dark night. As you look up into the darkness, a streak of light flashes across the sky. Could it be an alien spaceship? Probably not. Perhaps, <strong>more realistically,</strong> it's a shooting star.</p>\n<p>\"Shooting stars are pieces of dust and rock from space that are falling to Earth. As they pass through the gas that makes up our atmosphere they get <strong>hotter and hotter </strong>and start to glow as they fall.\"</p>\n<p>This excerpt from a BBC science story has a good example of how we can repeat a comparative to emphasise how something changes: \"they get <strong>hotter and hotter</strong>\". The comparative is repeated and linked with <strong>and.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some more examples from the BBC website:</p>\n<p><em>\"Halloween is over, and bonfire night is nearly here, meaning Christmas is getting <strong>closer and closer</strong>.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"... the eternally scrolling page that just gets <strong>longer and longer</strong> and <strong>slower and slower</strong>.\"<br/></em><em><br/></em>Of course, some comparatives are made with the word <strong>more</strong>. For these - we repeat <strong>more</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>\"...[we] need to be <strong>more and more efficient</strong>.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"It also helps to explain why, when it comes to housing refugees, the burden falls <strong>more and more heavily</strong> on developing countries.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"For the last few years, rains have become <strong>more and more unpredictable</strong>.\"</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Combining comparatives</h3>\n<p>You might not know Gary Player. He is one of the best golfers of all time. He is also famous for a saying which combines comparatives.</p>\n<p>He was very skilful and was often successful with very difficult shots. Someone commented that he was very lucky. This didn't please Player, who worked very hard to be a good golfer. His reply has now become legendary.</p>\n<p><em>\"Well <strong>the harder</strong> I practise, <strong>the luckier</strong> I get.\"</em></p>\n<p>This is a perfect example of a structure that connects two comparative ideas. Doing more of one thing, leads to an increase in another thing. Here are some more examples.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The slower</strong> the bus went, <strong>the more impatient</strong> the passengers became.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>The later</strong> it got, <strong>the more worried</strong> I became.</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now try our next quiz. This gives you the chance to do more practice with comparatives and superlatives. In each question, choose the best options to complete the sentences. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now why not join Finn and Catherine and listen to 6 Minute Grammar on this topic.

You'll read a story about it with lots of examples of comparatives and superlatives.</p>\n<p>But first, take a look at this <strong>timelapse</strong> video of its construction. There's no language in it, it's just to show you how the tower was built, before you read the story.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Watch the video and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Here's our article about the speedily built skyscraper. First, read it quickly and choose which of these statements is correct:<br/></span></span><br/><span>1.</span>       <span><span>Broad Group say that environmental damage is the price you pay for tall towers</span></span></p>\n<p><span>2.</span>       <span><span>Broad Group say that tall towers are more environmentally friendly</span></span></p>\n<p><span>3.</span>       <span><span>Broad Group say safety is more important than environmental concerns</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>The story: Mini Sky City</span></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Part 1<br/></strong><span><span>Mini Sky City isn't the <strong>tallest</strong> tower in China. It's only a third of the height of Shanghai's <strong>loftiest</strong>. But the speed at which it was built has been <strong>turning heads</strong>. The tower <strong>shot up</strong> at the speed of three storeys per day, reaching a height of 204 metres after only 19 days of <strong>construction</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2<br/></strong><span><span>How did the company behind it, Broad Group, build it so fast? The answer is that it was made in a factory. The tower is <strong>assembled</strong> from steel parts made on a <strong>production line</strong>, which are then driven to the building site and <strong>slotted</strong> <strong>together</strong> like Lego. Broad Group says using steel parts makes their technique not only <strong>quicker</strong>, but also <strong>safer than</strong> conventional concrete buildings which are less <strong>flexible</strong> in earthquakes.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>Part 3<br/></strong><span><span>And next on the company's list is an ambitious plan to build the <strong>world's tallest tower</strong>. <strong>Dubbed</strong> Sky City, they say it will be <strong>even taller than</strong> the 828m Burj Khalifa in Dubai. They say it will take only seven months to build a 'vertical city' using their modular technique, with homes, schools, offices and even hospitals and indoor farms for 30,000 people inside. They claim it would reduce the need for cars, and therefore would be more environmentally friendly than a normal city. Critics are not so sure. Some say it could be unsafe, others think it is a <strong>vanity project</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>Part 4<br/></strong><span><span>And is <strong>higher</strong> necessarily <strong>better</strong>? A phrase in English is: <strong>the bigger they are, the harder they fall</strong>. One theory says that skyscrapers are always built before an <strong>economic crisis</strong>. </span></span><span><span>Whatever happens, it looks like this trend will continue, as we build higher and higher. In Saudi Arabia, a tower is under construction that will have a height of over one kilometre when finished. The Kingdom Tower is expected to be completed in 2018. </span></span><span><span>So, what do you think? Is this human desire to build <strong>ever higher</strong> just <strong>pie in the sky</strong>, or is it really true that <strong>the sky's the limit</strong>?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Which statement was correct?</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span><span>The correct statement is 2. Broad Group say that tall towers are more environmentally friendly, because they reduce the need for cars.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Now read the article again and answer these questions. They will test your understanding of the story and the grammar from this unit.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What do you think?</h3>\n<p>Would you like to live in a skyscraper? Maybe you already live in a very tall building. Is life in the skies better than living on the ground? Try to use some comparatives and superlatives in your answer.</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Uyen, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>I am living in three-storey house. Most of houses in my neighborhood are three-storey houses. My country acreage is small and Vietnamese population is very much. So, almost people have to build their houses with many storeys. The center buildings which include offices, stores, restaurants, hotels... be usually more than twenty storeys.</p>\n<p>I'd like living on the ground than living on the skyscraper. Because of fire is happened, we will evacuate more easily.</p>\n<h3>Ida</h3>\n<p>To my mind living on the ground floor is more human, it suits older people, it demands less energy to keep it running, it's environmentally friendly, but no doubt it doesn't suit the huge, each day bigger, city population, mostly in countries like China, or in those which jobs are restricted to few cities, such as Brazil  Rio and São Paulo.</p>\n<h3>Airin, Japan</h3>\n<p>There are pros and cons of living in a skysclaper. If you live in the sky, you would not come across annoying bugs, like mosquitoes or flies. And you can see a breathtakingly beautiful sunrise and sunset without disturebed by other buildings if you live in the highest building in the area.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you would face difficulties if natural disasters happen. You can't use a lift when the electricity supply is cut. In that case, you have to go down more than a thousand steps to evacuate, or go up the same number of steps to go back to your home. What is worse, you may not be able to use tap water. Water can not be supplied to upper floors without motor pumps.</p>\n<p>If you are in a region where natural disasters hit frequently, it may be better to live on the ground.</p>\n<h3>Ngọc Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>I think it would be fantastic to stand on the top of the loftiest towers. I can see everything on the ground like houses, buildings, trees, traffic, etc. It looks like I'm using a map but this one is much livelier and more realistic than any other map drawn on a paper or provided by a satellite. Besides, watching the sun rising or going down on the horizon would make me more relaxed. But living in a skyscraper may not be a good idea. Although I'm not a victim of any fire or terrorist attack, I'm haunted by these things. How can I survive? Until I become an expert in escape, the closer to the ground I live, the safer I feel.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Angel, Madrid</h3>\n<p>I've never really lived in a skyscraper. I've been working in a small one, not high enough to be known for its height and it doesn't exist any long. I was working for an American company as an accountancy auditor, consultant and tax specialist close to El Corte Inglés in Madrid. It was burned by night and with several people inside. Nobody died. Nobody knows what happened and has been written a lot about it. Lots of confidential information was kept there. Banks, corporate finance, goverment related names, politics, political parties, bank of Spain presidents, ... All disapeared.</p>\n<h3>Lucas</h3>\n<p>Although many people love to living in the tall building, but I prefer to live on the ground. Some people think that it's more easier to viewing the vision of sky city, and  also can fill with their vanity, but living in the skyscraper still has some problems such as cost more expense living and more busier in general.</p>\n<p>I love to living on the ground, because it is more quite and more relax compare to living in the tall tower. You don't put much more pressure on your shoulder to handle the expense living so that you can save some wages to plan a trip with your family, friends or relatives. That is my opinion about this article. </p>\n<h3>Franco</h3>\n<p>I think that a skyscrapers are very comfortable than a common city because the school, shopping  centre and the park lot is there, but the skyscrapers are less environmental friendly than the common city because this building uses more energy for heater than the city.</p>\n<p>The most important thing is this construction, the people live where they work and study for example. </p>\n<h3>Robson, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I have never lived in a skyscraper but I would like to live in. There are a lot of Skyscraper in my city and the Highest has 400 meters.</p>\n<p>Last week I went to visit a skyscraper, Wow my god! It was amazing! My friend invited me to take the lift and we went to the top of building. There was very windy and we were very afraid, but at the end was very good because we could see a beautiful sunset. </p>\n<h3>Jurate, Lithuania</h3>\n<p>Reading news about higher and higher towers being built around the World I sometimes wonder what it would feel like to be living in a skyscraper around 300 meters high which would be already 10 meters higher than the highest mountain in my country. My home country Lithuania could rank among the most plane places on Earth. And its tallest residential building reaches only 112 meters (367 feet) high. It is far away from reaching the sky. But does higher mean safer more luxurious and more comfortable? I used to live at a university hall which was 56 meters high and my room was on the 16th floor. The view from the window at night, when the city lit up, was the most impressive. We didn't use curtains or blinds. But there were inconveniences. The lifts usually shut down at about 10 at night, the rubbish chute clogged and there were accidents with drunk students who fell down from balconies at the parties.</p>\n<h3>Nadia, France</h3>\n<p>Living in a skyscraper is difficult. At the highest storey, anyone can be attracted to the ground and fall.</p>\n<p>There must be several reasons to build its skyskrapers. Many people are more attracted by the town than by the countryside. Public transport are more numerous and libraries, schools, shops are nearer.</p>\n<p>Living on the ground hasn't ever advantages. In the countrysides, there are more or less a compulsory to own a car or another vehicle to move in. Public transports are scarer and drivers of busses complain as much as drivers in subways.</p>\n<h3>Angela Ronchi, Italy</h3>\n<p>I live in a small village, in one of the smallest Italian regions, very far from the biggest towns, such as Milan or Bologna or Rome. So, it's difficult there to find out how living in the highest building of your town is...</p>\n<p>But, according to my experience - at the moment I live in a country house that is wider than tall - I think that living in \"vanity\" buildings is far too expensive for common citizens: it's not economic - because of the number of parts this buildings are composed of, because of the energy they require in winter and summer, the coldest and the hottest seasons of the year. Most of all, houses like these \"eat\" your time! Time... to be cleaned and tidied up, to be repaired, time to join rooms from the ground to the upper floor, from the eastern to western rooms...</p>\n<p>When I go on journeys or tours that take me into big towns, I don't like staying in big hotels, I'm a bit scared of wide castles and I stare at the longest walls of the main palace in capital cities! I'm concerned in terms of human work and environmental impact, of course!</p>\n<p>For other reasons, I don't even like the highest bell towers of ancient times in our Italian towns: have you ever climbed those narrow stairs - fifty centimeters wide and high - with only the strongest heart beating of yours and the shortest breath of your lungs, thinking : \"Well, I'll be out before it falls!\"?</p>\n<p>When I saw on the internet the loftiest constructions in the world, I contemplated them more astonished than ever, as I had seen the Babylon tower, or mountains of concrete, contemporary temples of ambition. Although I thought of the energy supplies they had required to be built or they would have for the turnover of the stuff they are made of, I admire human being when they want to demonstrate that the sky's the limit! But, this is one of the hottest next generation concerns! </p>\n<p>Howerver, how can we justify this human desire of magnificence with the need to preserve our soil, water, air and energy for the future? What can I say to my school children, when they take turns to switch off the lights in their classroom, if I'm aware of the economic crisis and at the same time I'm no more confident in \"locally acting for globally preserving\"?</p>\n<p>Is being environmentally friendly still a \"must\" in education or just a pie in the sky?</p>\n<h3>Anastasiya, Russia</h3>\n<p>People always want to subdue lands where they live. So I think they would build higher and higher buildings. As for me, I'm destined to live on the ground.  I used to have a bad headache on last floors of skyscrapers. Some months ago I visited a friend of mine in her new flat on the twenty-fifth floor. She had a house-warning party, and we bought plenty of food and drinks. Two elevators in her new housing weren't worked and we were forced to go upstairs with our heavy bags. The higher I climbed, the heavier my bags became. We needed rest on tenth and twentieth floors. After all, she said, that it was a common situation for her and it helped her to be lean without gym and fitness. When I'd gone to the balcony, I was really shocked. There were no trees and green lawns around the house. Only tall buildings were everywhere. They were much closer, than it seemed outside. I saw the boy playing computer game behind the nearest window. And there were several buildings under construction. Some of them were taller than my friend's house. I think it's terrible. I hate to live among concrete walls and building sites. It is their profit that concern developers. The more expensive become a square meter living space the higher and higher and closer and closer they build. In my humble opinion the problem is not in people's vanity.  The sky is the limit for their pursuit of profit.</p>\n<h3>Uyen, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>In my opinion. I'd love living on the ground because 3 reason below:</p>\n<p>First of all, The Sky normally is very high; Consequently, it took you a lot of times to went to your house in the high building by elevator. Sometimes, The evelator will be crash or are being fix; therefore, its waste of our time.</p>\n<p>Secondly. As a result of  the building might be at risk of the bad weather like: storm, wind, earthquake, High building is taller than the other.</p>\n<p>The last. Living on the ground is more easier to earn money than living on the skies because you can open the shop or something without hire with the high cost. In my countries, Vietnam, it said: \"The more nearer you live on the ground, the more money you can earn.\"</p>\n<p>Actually, I have been living on the 5th floor in the old building for 20 years. I really want to living on the ground owing to I was really exhausted when I went to my house by foot without elevator.</p>\n<h3>Dzung, Hanoi, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>I've lived in Hanoi since 1998. It's an ancient city and it's well known with thirty six old streets where we just have small houses and very old. Many tourists come here every year to learn about its history and about our beautiful country.</p>\n<p>We want to keep it because of history. Today, Hanoi was protracted and much larger than before. And in the new areas where we have the tallest buiding in the country. The loftiest one is Keangnam. For many people it's like a development symbol. The richest try to buy its flats which is one of the highest price in the world for one meter square.</p>\n<p>Our country is under developt and I think it will be have many loftiest edifices in early future. And I think it's good if it's envirmontally friendly and have quality green space for kids enjoy their life. We dream in the green future and fresh not for the tallest building. Whatever we do, we always want to protect the enviroment for the better life. Tall buiding can not resolve the climate change and I myself don't like it at all.</p>\n<h3>Melody, Taiwan</h3>\n<p>I was absolutely amazed by the brilliant building skills the company uses, but I'm not so sure the necessaries for building the world's tallest tower. I can't understand why sometimes human tend to make things more complicate than before, we even create problems to bother ourselves. In my opinion, I don't think life in the skies is better than living on the ground. Although technical changes become faster and faster, I believe the simpler live we live, the happier life we have. The whole world is the biggest playground we can have, I think the more wider we can see, the more flexible we are.   </p>\n<h3>Maria, Russia​</h3>\n<p>Today population is rapidly growing worldwide. Owing to the urbanisation, many cities and several towns are fast becoming much larger than one hundred year ago. The process, when people move to the urban areas for jobs, convinces officials to think seriously about launching of large-scale projects on building new houses, office buildings and objects of social housing.</p>\n<p>In Russia dwellers were mostly concentrated in a few major cities. The contemporary urban society lives in flats. You may see skyscapers in the centre of cities where they are essential type of town architecture.</p>\n<p>To live in skyscraper appears to be not such good as in a cosy house with a garden. In this case, you have a wonderful opportunity to breathe fresh air and to admire the excellent  view.</p>\n<h3>Raul</h3>\n<p>I don't like the skyscrapers because I think they are a problema for the earth. Only big cities have big skyscrapers and these cities have much people, the big cities are concrete jungles. </p>\n<p>I prefere the simple life, our earth is limit and we cannot mistreating.</p>\n<h3>Khalid, Yemen</h3>\n<p>The skyscraper's construction is one of competitive fields between companies, countries, and nations, so we're keeping hear people build  taller and taller, they work faster and faster there is no limit of human ambition. When I look at my country even the whole world  I see variety in buildings' style and that what gives our world the beauty. </p>\n<p>I prefer living on the ground house than higher, because I love open houses  which have yards and gardens, also I love the soil and it's smell especially in raining times it make me happier. I think the reason of why I love the soil or ground is that it's the source of life.</p>\n<p>N.B.: Shibam is a Yemeni city called \"the oldest skyscraper city in the world\" or \"the Manhattan of the desert\", which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud brick and about 500 of them are tower blocks. </p>\n<h3>Manuel Juan, Spain </h3>\n<p>I  think I wouldn't like to live in a skyscraper for long periods of time. Maybe a couple of weeks would be enough living higher than usual in order to satisfy our natural curiosity. After that I would come back to the ground which really is our best habitat as our body is made for walking, no flying.</p>\n<p>Environmentally speaking I don't believe that skyscraper or small sky cities would be the more confortable solution. So many people living in such a reduced space would mean more stressed people than living in spacious cities with smaller building. Cheaper and faster public means of transport could be the best option instead private cars which produce a great deal of exhaust fumes.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>I think that the more populous cities are, the more need there is for tall buildings. And besides, I think that the richer you are, the more you are likely to live in a skyscraper. I live in a six-storey building and there are no skyscrapers nearby. I don't know whether it is better living in a skyscraper or not, but anyway I am not so curious to know. Personally, I am afraid of heights although the sight of a very tall building is always spectacular.</p>\n<h3>Lineda, France</h3>\n<p>I can't bear living in a tall building for many reasons:</p>\n<p>On the one hand I am afraid of heights and I feel dizzy and sick when I am at the top of a tall building and on the other hand what would happen if the safest building was struck by a earthquake or if a fire broke out. Besides how many steps I would go up if the lift didn't work.</p>\n<p>Apart from these troubles I admit that we can get a stunning bird's eye view of a tall  skyscraper. The taller the building is the more amazing view you get.</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I'm not sure I'd like to live in a skyscraper all time. There are advantages and disadvantages. For example, if I lived on the hundredth floor, I'd be forced to get to my apartment by lift. But it isn't always reliably. I'd could to stuck there and as result be late for work. But also it has its advantages. On this height likely I wouldn't hear a street noise and breathe a fresher air than on the ground. Therefore to live in higher building isn't bad.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos </h3>\n<p>At the beginning all we were very happy. We were going to live and work in a mini-city-skyscraper, the first one in the metropolis. Inside and out of the big built there were big electric power plants, giant water tanks, and a satellite supplied communication and internet for all the inhabitants. Into the tower we don’t need cars, there is a system of horizontal movement to travel from a part to other of the same level, then you have the elevators, you can select your floor number with your smartphone before lifting. The electrical light pretends the sun light very well and with the air conditioning and the high roofs you think you are on the street. My wife works in other side and other floor, and our daughter is schooled on the same level.</p>\n<p>When they finished the big tower the problems began. We noticed that the highest floors had different facilities and the access was different too.</p>\n<p>They can go to the hospital directly from their flats or can receive their medicines or their packs with drones. The airport is on the top and we need and special card to get there.</p>\n<p>Last month we filled up an application to come back to the ground but we don't have any answer yet.</p>\n<h3>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I think we shouldn't live in skyscraper. We don't have wings! Life in houses with a garden where we can plant roses  or cultivate a vegetable garden is the best thing for us. </p>\n<h3>Pawan Bhandari, Nepal</h3>\n<p>I would've loved to live in sky scraper if my country, Nepal, hadn't been prone to earthquakes.Nepalese pride themselves living in the country of Mt .Everest(8848m), loftiest among all the mountains. But, it comes with a downside,  the rugged topography falls in the seismic range, being vulnerable to earthquakes. </p>\n<p>The recent earthquake is the testimony to the fact that Nepal isn't suitable for tall constructions. Most of the tall buildings roughly 20 storied, were severely damaged resulting in a catastrophic event. This led people to believe , life in the ground is much better than in skies. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, I would like to reminisce the sep 11 attack in USA and give condolence to the people of France. The tall buildings were the target of the terrorist; this atrocious and barbaric act made people fear the height - the taller the building,  the more apprehensive people became. </p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>I have never visited a skyscraper but, in fact, it would be great to do so. In my opinion, living in one of the loftiest tower is thoroughly thinkable. That can permit to have a better outlook on the city for instance, and to feel safer, because when you live on the ground, you are much more likely to be annoyed by the noise of the cars, or to be burgled than if you dwell in the skies. </p>\n<p>Currently, I'm living at the eighth floor of the building of my residence and admittedly, I would have liked to live higher in the sky. </p>\n<p>I hope that in the future, some great buildings will be constructed ever taller and quicker, and thus that a real \"skyscrapers craze\" will spread all around the world. </p>\n<h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>And that's it. We hope your knowledge of comparatives and superlatives is <strong>better</strong> now! In the next session we look at something completely different: how to chat someone up...</p></div>",

Can I have yours? </p>\n<p>Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?</p>\n<p>Is it hot in here or is it just you?</p>\n<p>You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>OK, right, thanks for those Neil! I'm Finn - and Neil has just said a few chat up lines. They weren't for me Neil were they?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, they were just examples, Finn. Just examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's a relief. Now, I'm no expert in chatting people up, of course. So I've just searched online and most websites say: don't use a chat-up line, like Neil just did. They're quite traditional - even quite <strong>cheesy</strong>, which means of bad quality, they're the kind of thing that make you groan, like this. (Finn groans) That's a groan. So maybe if you're very confident or if you say them in a funny way they might just work.</p>\n<p>But otherwise, what can you say if you want to chat someone up? Can we teach you anything to help you chat people up in English? Let's listen to some examples. So, we've got Neil here again, with Helen - let's see if he can do a better job this time. Let's imagine they're waiting at a bus stop. Does Neil do a good job?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hi. Have you seen the 185 go by?</p>\n<p><strong>Helen</strong><br/>No, I haven't. I only just got here.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right, OK. It's really hot, isn't it? It's hot today.</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>Yeah, it's a... lovely day.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. So, have you got a lighter?</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>No. I don't smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. Neither do I.</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>Right...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, can I have your phone number?</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, right.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK, well that wasn't too good. It started well. Neil started by asking something about their surroundings. He <strong>broke the ice</strong>. That's a good phrase. To break the ice is to say or do something in a situation where people don't know each other - maybe the situation is a bit tense, or a bit cold, like ice, then you say something that helps people relax and talk to each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hi. Have you seen the 185 go by?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, Neil continued with another line about their surroundings: \"Is it hot today?\" Now that's fine, but then after that it started to go a bit wrong. Listen again. What do you think he did wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. So, have you got a lighter?</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>No. I don't smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. Neither do I.</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>Right...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, can I have your phone number?</p>\n<p><strong>Helen<br/></strong>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, right.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yeah, Neil was a bit too direct. He should have probably made sure she was interested, or at least a little bit interested, before asking for Helen's number. So, sorry, no points for Neil there. If you want to chat someone up, you do need to be confident, but you also need to listen: so, both listen to what they say and listen to their body language - the way they're sitting or looking at you. So, ask questions of course, but also listen.</p>\n<p>Now, time for another example. Let's see if Catherine can do any better. She's just seen a very handsome man at a conference - that's Rob - and she wants to chat him up. It's lunch time and Rob is helping himself to a nice, free sandwich at this conference... Catherine goes across to speak to him. How does she do?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Nice sandwiches?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You can't beat a free sandwich.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You can't, can you? Have you tried the sushi? It's quite good you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Actually, no. It does look good.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The salmon sashimi is incredible. But your cheese sandwich looks nice as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh, thanks very much.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Anyway, how's the conference? Are you having a good one?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, yeah, not bad. I'm doing a presentation this afternoon.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh what's it about, anything good?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, water pipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Water pipes?! Fascinating, you'll have to tell me all about that. Can I join you while you have your cheese sandwich?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yeah, yeah, OK then.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Lovely.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right - so Catherine did a few things there that helped keep Rob interested. She started by breaking the ice - which is good. She commented on their surroundings - in this case, lunch. She said:</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Nice sandwiches?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And then she suggested something just a bit different, maybe to make herself sound interesting. She said: \"I like the sushi\" - and asked if he'd tried it:</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You can't beat a free sandwich.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You can't, can you? Have you tried the sushi? It's quite good you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Actually, no.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now Rob didn't seem too interested, so Catherine asked another question, but nothing too personal:</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Anyway, how's the conference? Are you having a good one?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>They're at a conference, so asking about a conference isn't too personal. And she showed interest in what Rob was saying:</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, yeah, not bad. I'm doing a presentation this afternoon.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh what's it about, anything good?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, water pipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Water pipes?! Fascinating, you'll have to tell me all about that.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And then, when she was confident he was just a bit interested in her, she bravely asked an important question:</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Can I join you while you have your cheese sandwich?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yeah, yeah, OK then.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Lovely.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, well done Catherine. And let's summarise some points from those two conversations. First, break the ice by commenting on something around you. And then, just ask a few questions, nothing too personal, and remember, do listen to what they say. And finally - don't be scared to ask a slightly more direct question at the end - it might be your only chance! </p>\n<p>All these skills are important in normal conversation too, so don't worry if you're married or you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, or you just don't want to chat someone up! You don't need to chat someone up to use these skills, it's still good to know how to break the ice and how to listen well.</p>\n<p>So there we go. The art of chatting someone up, as brought to you by BBC Learning English. Before I go, has anyone ever told you look like Angelina Jolie?</p> </div>",

It's really just learning how to listen and keep someone's attention. And if all else fails, you can always use a cheesy chat-up line!</p>\n<p>In the next session, we continue with the topic of love in Part 3 of our drama, The Importance of Being Earnest. Jack has asked the person of his dreams, Gwendolen, to marry him. But Gwendolen's mother is not at all happy with the plan.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>     <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Catherine…</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And I’m Finn. Today we’re talking about suffixes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>A suffix is a group of letters at the end of a word, which can tell you what kind of word it is. In today’s programme we’re looking at <strong>-ment, </strong>spelt<strong> m-e-n-t, -ance</strong> spelt<strong> a-n-c-e, </strong>and </span><span><strong>-ence, </strong>spelt <strong>e-n-c-e</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>The last two sound quite similar, don't they? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>They do.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span><strong>-ance</strong> and <strong>-ence</strong>. But first, let’s hear from Tania. She loves to dance. She’s talking about her recent visit to the ballet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. While you listen, think about this question: Did Tania enjoy the ballet in the end?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span>There was huge <strong>excitement</strong> in the audience. This was the Bolshoi’s only <strong>performance</strong> of Swan Lake in London. But at half past seven a man appeared and made an <strong>announcement</strong>. He thanked us for our <strong>patience</strong> and then said that the lead dancer was ill and couldn’t <strong>perform</strong>. In the <strong>silence</strong> that followed, you could feel everyone’s <strong>disappointment</strong>. But the <strong>replacement </strong>dancer was wonderful. She wasn’t too <strong>confident</strong> to start with, but her <strong>confidence</strong> grew and, in the end, the lead dancer’s <strong>absence</strong> didn’t lessen my <strong>enjoyment </strong>at all. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So we asked you: Did Tania enjoy the ballet in the end?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>And the answer was: Yes, she did. The lead dancer’s <strong>absence</strong> didn’t lessen her <strong>enjoyment.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>absence</strong> and <strong>enjoyment</strong> are two key words in this programme. The noun <strong>absence</strong> with the suffix <strong>-ence</strong>, spelt <strong>e-n-c-e,</strong> means someone or something not being there. It comes from the adjective <strong>absent</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and the noun <strong>enjoyment</strong> with the suffix <strong>-ment</strong> comes from the verb <strong>enjoy</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s listen to a clip with more words with <strong>-ment</strong> and <strong>-ence, </strong>spelt<strong> e-n-c-e</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span>In the <strong>silence</strong> that followed, you could feel everyone’s <strong>disappointment</strong>. But the <strong>replacement </strong>dancer was wonderful. She wasn’t too <strong>confident</strong> to start with, but her <strong>confidence</strong> grew.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So we had two nouns with the suffix <strong>-ence</strong>,spelt<strong> e-n-c-e</strong>:<strong> silence</strong> and <strong>confidence</strong>. The noun <strong>silence</strong> comes from the adjective <strong>silent</strong>,meaning complete quiet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and the noun <strong>confidence</strong>, which comes from the adjective <strong>confident</strong>, means having belief in your own abilities. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Notice that both adjectives end in the letter <strong>t</strong>, which changes to a letter <strong>c</strong> in the suffix <strong>-</strong><strong>ence</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So<strong> silent</strong> becomes <strong>sil-ence</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and <strong>confident</strong> becomes <strong>confid-ence</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Other common adjectives ending in the letter <strong>t</strong> that add <strong>e-n-c-e</strong> are: <strong>independent </strong>and<strong> different</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>…which become <strong>independence </strong>and<strong> difference.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>In the clip, we also heard two more words with the suffix <strong>-ment</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we heard <strong>disappointment, </strong>which comes from the verb <strong>disappoint</strong>, meaning a feeling of being unhappy because you have been let down.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and <strong>replacement</strong>, which comes from the verb <strong>replace</strong> and means a thing or person which takes the place of something or someone else. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now, let’s hear another clip. Listen out for two words with the suffixes<strong> -ance</strong> with an <strong>a</strong> and <strong>-ence </strong>with an <strong>e</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span></strong><span>There was huge <strong>excitement</strong> in the audience. This was the Bolshoi’s only <strong>performance</strong> of Swan Lake in London. But at half past seven a man appeared and made an <strong>announcement</strong>. He thanked us for our <strong>patience</strong> and then said that the lead dancer was ill and couldn’t perform.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So we had the noun <strong>performance</strong>, spelt <strong>a-n-c-e </strong>at the end, which comes from the verb <strong>perform</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>patience</strong>, spelt<strong> e-n-c-e </strong>at the end, from the adjective <strong>patient</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Did you spot the two words with the suffix <strong>–ment</strong>? <strong>Excitement </strong>from the verb <strong>excite</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and <strong>announcement </strong>from the verb <strong>announce</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>BBC Learning English dot com.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, time for a quiz. And ready for number one? Is the word <strong>silence</strong> spelt a) s-i-l-e-n-c-e or b) s-i-l-a-n-c-e? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It’s a) s-i-l-e-n-c-e.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Very good. Number two: What’s the noun that comes from the verb <strong>replace?</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It's <strong>replacement.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And, number three: Complete this sentence: Maria lacks a) confident or b) confidence?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It's b)<strong> confidence. </strong>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And now, here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: choose a word and then think of all the different forms of that word, so think of a noun, adjective and verb all with the same root.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>.

In the next activity we're going to see if you can use your knowledge of these suffixes to work out the meanings of some words you might not know already - a great way to build vocabulary.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>So, first we need your help to tell a story. This time we're going to meet a young singer by the name of Sayla Twift.</p>\n<p>Fill in the gaps in the sentences using your knowledge of suffixes.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>We hope that activity has given you some useful <strong>experience</strong> of using these suffixes. In the next activity we'll look at some patterns that can give you even more <strong>confidence!</strong></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Learn the root</h3>\n<p><span><span>Here's a tip to help you develop your vocabulary skills.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The English language is like a tree. If you learn the <strong>root</strong> word, you can work out many other parts. Knowing prefixes and suffixes can really help with this.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>For example – the verb <strong>employ</strong>. You can think of this as a 'root' that several 'branches' grow from:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>If you have a job - you are <strong>employed</strong>. </span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><strong>Employed</strong> is the past participle of <strong>employ,</strong> and it's also an adjective. </span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>You can make <strong>employ</strong> into a noun by adding <strong>–ment. </strong></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><strong>Employment</strong> is 'the state of being employed'. </span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>An <strong>employer </strong>is 'someone who employs people'.</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>An <strong>employee</strong> is 'someone who is employed'. </span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>And don't forget prefixes – <strong>unemployment</strong> is the state of not being employed.</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span>So – just from one root word, with some knowledge of prefixes and suffixes, we suddenly have a little family: a little tree of words!</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Here's a little story to help you practise your word families. The three root words are <strong>support</strong>, <strong>friend</strong> and <strong>use</strong>. Try to work out the correct answers using your knowledge of these words.</p>\n<p>Here are a few <strong>suffixes</strong> to help you.</p>\n<p><strong>-less</strong> = 'without'</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>worthless, tasteless</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>-able</strong> = creates an adjective meaning that the subject can do something OR that something can be done to it</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>excitable, loveable, breakable</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>-er</strong> = it's a job or skill</p>\n<p><em>presenter, teacher, train driver</em></p>\n<p><strong>-ive</strong> = makes an adjective from a verb</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>attractive, abusive, protective</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And two <strong>prefixes</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>un-</strong> = 'not' the word that comes after</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>unemployed, unworthy, unfair</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>re-</strong> = 'again'</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>reuse, reheat, re-educate</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>And that's it for this session: well done! In Session 2 we're going to look at an important tense - the past perfect continuous. <strong>Had you been hoping</strong> that we would practise that tense?</p></div>",

Today, we're talking about the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong> tense…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>… which we use to give background information to an event in the past. We'll give you lots of examples.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>We'll explain when to use the past perfect simple instead of the past perfect continuous…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>… and of course we'll finish with a quiz.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Let's start with an example.

Joe had been living in London for two years when they met.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>So, we use the past perfect continuous to talk about something that was happening before another event or situation in the past. We can use it when we want to say how long this earlier action was happening for.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Now, in this case <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>had been living</strong> tells us what Joe was doing up to the time he met Alice.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's right. And the later action <strong>when they met</strong> was in the past simple. Let's hear that example again.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Joe and Alice got together in 2012. Joe had been living in London for two years when they met.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Here's another example. Which action happened first?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>We had been trying to open the door for five minutes when I finally found the key.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>So <strong>we had been trying</strong>, in the past perfect continuous, was the earlier action.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Exactly. Sometimes, the action or situation that happens first in time comes second in the sentence.

He had been training for it since 2010.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>So, the past perfect continuous phrase <strong>he had been training </strong>came in the second part of the sentence, but it happened earlier in time.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yes. And the event that happened later in time: <strong>Jack</strong> <strong>ran the marathon</strong>, was in the past simple and came first in the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Right. So, here's another sentence. Can you work out which action or happened first?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>He missed the train, which he'd been hoping to catch.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>The earlier action was <strong>he’d been hoping</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>That's right. So, in that example the past perfect continuous was in a relative clause: <strong>which he had been hoping</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's quite common with the past perfect continuous. And another common structure to use with past perfect continuous is a time conjunction, like this:</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>After I had been swimming for an hour, I was so cold I had to stop.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>So, we had <strong>after</strong> plus <strong>I had been swimming.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yes, and that is the past perfect continuous in relative clauses and after time conjunctions.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Now, we form the past perfect continuous with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>had been </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb. Here are those examples again, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Joe had been living…</p>\n<p>We’d been trying…</p>\n<p>I had been swimming…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>For negative sentences, it's <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>hadn't been </strong>and the present participle.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>I hadn't been waiting very long when the bus arrived.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>And don't forget those short forms: <strong>I had</strong> becomes <strong>I'd</strong>;<strong> We had </strong>is<strong> we'd</strong>;<strong> had not </strong>is<strong> hadn't</strong> and so on.</p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And we're talking about the past perfect continuous.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>We often use it to give background information about a situation or event that was happening up to another event in the past…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>… which is usually in the past simple.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Sometimes we can use either the past perfect simple or the past perfect continuous, particularly for activities that continue for a long time, like <strong>work, run </strong>or <strong>sleep</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>So we can say:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had slept</strong> all afternoon.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> Or we can say:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had been sleeping</strong> all day.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But if the earlier action had been completed, then we use the past perfect simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>I'd</strong> already <strong>cooked</strong> supper when Jan got home.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If the earlier action is incomplete, use the past perfect continuous, to focus on the process or length of time that the action continued, rather than the end result.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>And, now it's time for our quiz. Which is correct? Number one: a) I'd only been waiting a few minutes when the bus arrived. b) I only waited a few minutes when the bus had arrived.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> It’s a). We need the past perfect continuous for the earlier action or situation.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Correct. Number 2: a) After they'd been walking for three hours, they realised they were lost. b) After they walked for three hours, they'd realised they were lost.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And it's a) again. The earlier action was the walking, so that's in the past perfect continuous.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Good, finally, number 3: a) Sam finally bought the car that he'd saved up for. b) Sam finally bought the car that he'd been saving up for.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And this time, both are correct.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>That's right. Well done if you got them all right. There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong>Bye.</p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>In these sessions we're looking at the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong>. You may also hear it called the <strong>past perfect progressive</strong>, it's exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p>Let's start with a story about a girl called Maria.</p>\n<p><em>Last Sunday when Maria woke up and looked outside the weather was fine. There wasn't a cloud in the sky but there were puddles in the street and the garden was wet. <strong>It had been raining</strong>. <strong>She</strong> <strong>had been planning</strong> to go for a ride on her new bike but she decided to wait until it had dried up. She didn't want to get her bike dirty.</em></p>\n<p>There are two examples of the past perfect continuous here: <strong>it had been raining </strong>and <strong>she had been planning</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let's take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Question: When did Maria look out of the window, now or in the past?<br>Answer: In the past, last Sunday.</br></p>\n<p>Question: At this time in the past was it raining?<br/>Answer: No, the weather was fine.</p>\n<p>Question: There were puddles in the street, so when did it rain? Before, after or the same time as Maria looked out of the window?<br/>Answer: Before she looked out of the window.</p>\n<p>Question: So, why was the street wet?<br/>Answer: Because <strong>it had been raining</strong>.</p>\n<p>This example shows us that we use the past perfect continuous to talk about <strong>something that was happening over a period of time up to or before another point in the past</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Making the past perfect continuous</h3>\n<p>Now we know what it is, let's take a quick look at how we make it. The past perfect continuous follows this structure:</p>\n<p><strong>subject + 'd/had/hadn't + been + present participle (-ing form)</strong></p>\n<p><em>John went to the doctor because <strong>he'd been having</strong> trouble sleeping.</em><br/><em>We <strong>hadn't been waiting</strong> long when the taxi arrived.</em></p>\n<p>For the question form we just switch the <strong>subject</strong> and the <strong>had </strong>auxiliary:</p>\n<p><strong>Had/hadn't + subject + been + present participle</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Had you been drinking</strong> when you fell off your bike?</em></p>\n<h3>Past perfect continuous and the past simple</h3>\n<p>The past perfect continuous is often seen in sentences that also contain <strong>the past simple</strong>. They have a very close relationship. The past simple tells us about the most recent past activity and the past perfect continuous tells us what <strong>had been happening</strong> before that time.</p>\n<p>The past perfect continuous is useful for giving background information, explanations for and context to a past situation.</p>\n<p><em>Michal was exhausted (<strong>past simple</strong>) because he had been working (<strong>past perfect continuous</strong>) all night.</em></p>\n<p><em>It was clear the twins had been fighting (<strong>past perfect continuous</strong>) despite what they told (<strong>past simple</strong>) their mum.</em></p>\n<p><em>Up until the stock market crashed (<strong>past simple</strong>) property prices had been rising steadily (<strong>past perfect continuous</strong>).</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the exercise that follows you are going to read some more about Maria and her bike trip last Sunday.</p>\n<p>In each question you need to fill the gap with the best answer. The answers will either be the past perfect continuous or the past simple.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>How did you do? Really well, I hope. Now, if you're ready for some more, click to the next activity to read more about the past perfect continuous and how it compares to the past perfect simple.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Continuous or simple?</h3>\n<p>In some situations it's possible to use either the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong> or <strong>past perfect simple</strong> with very little change in meaning. This is true for single activities which are seen to last for some time.</p>\n<p><em>Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had been sleeping</strong> all afternoon.<br>Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had slept</strong> all afternoon.</br></em></p>\n<p>In some cases though, there are clear differences. For example when describing a repeated action compared to a single action. This is true for activities when were not really interested in how long they took. Our focus is more on the result of the activity rather than its duration.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Someone had been smashing </strong>car windows = </em>A repeated action<br/><em><strong>Someone had smashed </strong>my car windows =</em> A single action</p>\n<p>We use the <strong>continuous</strong> form for actions that continue for some time or are unfinished by a particular time or event in the past.</p>\n<p><em><strong>I'd been looking</strong> for a copy of that book for ages when I saw one in a charity shop.</em></p>\n<p>We prefer the <strong>simple</strong> form when talking about an action that was completed before a particular time or event in the past.</p>\n<p><em><strong>I'd given up</strong> hope of finding a copy of that book when out of the blue I saw one in a charity shop.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Reported speech</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>past perfect continuous </strong>is also used in <strong>reported speech</strong> when the past continuous is used in direct speech.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Direct speech:</strong> \"<strong>I</strong> <strong>was getting on</strong> the plane when I realised I'd left my passport in the departure lounge.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Reported speech:</strong> She told me that <strong>she'd been getting</strong> on the plane when she realised she'd left her passport in the departure lounge.</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Have you ever woken up early with the feeling that something wasn't quite right?</p>\n<p>In the activity you are going read about such a situation. You will need to finish the story by choosing the best option to complete each sentence.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now you've done so well in the quiz, why not listen to Neil and Catherine with 6 Minute Grammar? Let's hope they don't have any troubles such as flat tyres or flooded rooms!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Past perfect continuous</h3>\n<p>Do you want to talk about past events that happened before other past events?

Things are a bit busy at Tip Top Trading – the leading manufacturer of plastic imitation fruit. Mr Socrates – the big boss from America – has announced he's flying over to London for a 'spot check' on how the team's doing. So Anna is getting everyone to do a bit of <strong>spring cleaning</strong> to make sure the office looks clean and tidy – although it's not spring and so far, nobody has done any cleaning. </p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>Well there's nothing in my contract about cleaning... I only do sales – oh and a bit of <strong>admin</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>More admin than sales actually Denise. But I don't see why we need to tidy up for Mr S – I mean, it's a working office – it's not like our house Anna, that's a real dump!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Hmm... it is Tom – we need to talk about that – but anyway, I want Brad… I mean Mr Socrates to see we mean business – we have a clean, organised working environment – it shows we're serious about work...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Well not that serious...</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Tom! No, I want us all to spend today tidying up, throwing away paperwork we don't need, washing up dirty coffee mugs – that sort of thing. Come on everyone – let's do it!</p>\n<p>[everyone moans and groans]</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Well done Anna – you're <strong>taking the lead</strong> – showing them who's in charge – but how about offering them an <strong>incentive </strong>for doing a good job?  </p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>An incentive?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Yes – a reward that makes people want to work harder because they know they'll get something for doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Ah I see – OK I'll give it a try.</p>\n<p>[to team] Oh I forgot to say, if we do a good job there'll be a reward for your hard work</p>\n<p>[to herself] although I'm not sure what it will be yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>Oh well, why didn't you say – I'll get on with filing these invoices straight away, shall I?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>[suddenly keen] No, no it's OK Denise – leave those to me – you can rearrange the staplers if you like...</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>I'm quite capable of doing it thank you Tom – and then Anna shall I polish your desk?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>The team has really risen to the challenge – especially now there's an incentive. But what's going to happen at the end of the day when everyone usually goes home?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>OK everyone – thank you for your hard work – but it's five o'clock now.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Oh good - Is it time to knock off now?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Knock off?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Yeah, time to finish for the day – go home – I'll get my coat shall I?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Well, yes it is time to... 'knock off', so...</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>It's OK Anna, there's still a bit more spring cleaning to do – I know my contract says I work from 9 to 5 but... I'll ignore that just for today.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Of course, I don't need to go home <em>yet</em>, I could do some more tidying if you like – don't want to miss out on the 'incentive' do I Anna?</p>\n<p>[Tom and Denise argue as they continue to tidy up]</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Look both of you, just stop! Stop! Could you... err...</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Oh Anna – are you <strong>lost for words</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>If you mean, am I looking for the right thing to say, then yes – I think they've done enough work and should go home – even Tom.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Well say that – or something like...</p>\n<p>'I think that's enough for now.'... or</p>\n<p>'Let's leave it there'...</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Leave it where? </p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>There! – stop doing the task you were working on – it can always be finished later. And you could say... 'let's call it a day' – meaning let's end what we have been doing today.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>OK, very useful. I'll give those phrases a go.</p>\n<p>[To team]  It's now ten past five. I really think you've done enough for now – let's leave it there.</p>\n<p>[They continue to tidy up]</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Try a bit louder – oh and try saying 'let's wrap it up there' – that means bring the task to a close.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Right.  Denise, Tom let's wrap it up there – you've done really well but I think you should go home – especially you Tom – you're cooking dinner tonight.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>[surprised] Oh right.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>So let's leave it there – the office is looking much better and...</p>\n<p>[Door opens]</p>\n<p><strong>All<br/></strong>Oh no! Mr Socrates!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Oh no, he's arrived early. Luckily the office looks tidy. The team has worked hard but Anna's been a great manager and told them it's the end of the working day and to stop working by using these phrases...</p>\n<p>It's time to knock off</p>\n<p>You've done enough.</p>\n<p>I think that's enough for now.</p>\n<p>Let's leave it there.</p>\n<p>Let's call it a day.</p>\n<p>Let's wrap it up there.</p>\n<p>The team has done plenty of spring cleaning – but will Mr Socrates notice?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Oh hello Mr Socrates – what do you think of our... tidy office?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Socrates<br/></strong>Impressive – I can see Anna has everything in order – including you!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>[nervously] Ha ha! So Anna... what about that... incentive?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>[Realises she's forgotten] Oh, the incentive! Hmm... I know! Tom's cooking dinner tonight so Mr Socrates, Denise – would you like to come for dinner?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Wwwhat!                    </p> </div>",

In the London 2012 games athletes had to <strong>navigate</strong> a 4.7-kilometre track in under two hours.  The sport has several <strong>categories</strong>. 'Downhill' involves being taken by car or ski lift to a high point and riding all the way down to the bottom. You have to rely on your fitness, mental control, protective equipment and… luck! Tracks often include long jumps at high speed. It’s almost like flying!</span></br></p>\n<p><strong><span>Part 2</span></strong><br/><span>Talking of flying, why not go even higher? Skydivers jump from aircraft at an <strong>altitude</strong> of 1,000 to 4,000 metres. If you are high enough and your body is in the correct position to slow you down - with your belly turned to the ground rather than head-first - you can experience a one-minute <strong>free fall</strong> before <strong>deploying</strong> the all-important parachute. And there’s no age limit with this sport. Dilys Price from Cardiff went on her first jump aged 54. </span>She'd been having second thoughts, but her worries soon disappeared. <span>According to the British newspaper the Daily Mail she said: \"I thought 'this is instant death', but the minute I came down I wanted to go up again - I was <strong>hooked</strong>.\" Well, she's in her 80s now, and she’s still jumping…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Part 3</span></strong><br/><span>Some <strong>adrenaline junkies</strong> are even <strong>bolder </strong>– they've invented wingsuit flying: a sport in which you throw yourself <strong>into the void</strong> wearing an <strong>aerodynamic</strong><strong> </strong>suit. And then there's base jumping, in which people leap from tall structures such as buildings or bridges with a parachute. Some of their <strong>stunts</strong><strong> </strong>are illegal. Dan Witchalls had been skydiving for years when he decided to take up base jumping. He has jumped off The Shard - London's 310 metre-high skyscraper - four times. He says: \"Base jumping is scarier than jumping out of a plane. In a plane there is no perception of height, but when you are standing on the edge of the building you can see people and cars - it makes it very real.\"</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Part 4</span></strong><br/><span>It seems there’s no lack of imagination when it comes to risking life – and sometimes jail - to look cool and get the heart <strong>pounding</strong>.  Surfing, scuba diving, rock climbing… which one's for you? Not sure? Well, if you're busy at home, why not turn one of your chores into a <strong>daredevil </strong><strong>pursuit</strong>? 'Extreme ironing' is not for <strong>wimps</strong>! Pressing your shirt on top of a mountain could be the most dangerous sport of all, depending on the mountain.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Part 5</span></strong><br/><span>Extreme ironing is said to have been created in the 1990s in the English town of Leicester by a man who saw a pile of <strong>wrinkled</strong> clothes and felt bored. That was Phil Shaw who also won the only Extreme Ironing Championships ever held, in Germany in 2002. But the <strong>thrill</strong><strong> </strong>of this sport seems to come from looking at the spectators’ faces. Shaw says: \"Sometimes they look confused, sometimes they laugh. It’s fun to see how people respond to it.\"</span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Answer to our question: </span></span></h3>\n<p>Why is jumping off a building scarier than jumping out of a plane? Because there is no perception of height from a plane. When you jump off a building you can see people and cars, which makes it feel more real.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>To do</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Here are more questions for you - check how much of the article you understood and how well you've learnt the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong>.

We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Manuel Alegría, Cantabria, Spain</h3>\n<p>I like sports a lot, but not watching them at TV or in the stadiums, for example. I like to do exercise everyday because I consider that a healthy live is one of the most important things in modern life style. Therefore, I usually wake up at six o clock in the morning and go to run about thirty minutes, leaving exactly from my house. I've been doing this practice for thirty five years. At this time, I'm fifty five years old and I feel younger and healthier. You don't need the competition so that you can practice any sport.</p>\n<h3>Ewa, Poland</h3>\n<p>My husband and I took up sport - inland sailing - when we were in our fifties. We've been sailing regularly for 15 years now. We very much enjoy nature and tranguility that surrounds us when we are on board of our boat. Although you could not call this an extreme sport, inland sailing can be also very demanding.</p>\n<p>This year, we took on a new challenge: we have sailed the Great Loop of Wielkopolska. It's been 14 days of sun and rain, storms and obstacles (fallen trees, squalls, sandbanks) and 34 locks. And all that on a 8,8m long motor boat. We feel privileged and proud to have been able to complete our challenge.</p>\n<h3>Tristan</h3>\n<p>I dislike the extremes sport, because i am not bolder ^^. I prefer the</p>\n<p>standard sports like fencing, archery or football.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I have practiced fencing since 2002. I participated several competitions</p>\n<p>in French.</p>\n<p>I love archery because achieve a target is my purpose in all my hobbies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These sports help me build my life and give me a lot of satisfaction and</p>\n<p>a mind of competition.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>I started practising sports at an early age. My first sport was tennis, but sadly after I had been practising it for a while I realized that I wasn't any good at it. Then I took up football but soon I gave it a miss as I wasn't good at it either. Over the years I have been trying so many kind of sports, but now I have finally found the right one: Extreme learning English language. I have to swim through a sea of phrasal verbs, jump over long compound adjectives and travel the winding roads of irregular verbs. I hope that Extreme learning English language will be soon an Olympic discipline because I'd like to run for the gold medal.</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>Yes, I like sports especially football. I myself do exercise - I like running almost every morning and doing street workout (pull-up, push-up etc). Quite recent I managed to run 9 kilometre. Before I couldn’t even had dreamt of it. But constant training helps me do it. In future I’ll plan to run the marathon. What about extreme sports I don’t think that once I’ll start taking up it. It’s very dangerous for our life. Although the marathon also be attracted to extreme sports because to run such a long distance need great boldness, health and the willpower.</p>\n<h3>Nadia</h3>\n<p>Yes, I do but without exagerating. I'm used to go swimming one time a week all the year.</p>\n<p>If the swimming pool hadn't opened summer as winter, I think I'd run instead of.</p>\n<p>That allows to me to breath better and even if I am not very sportive, I enjoy walking,</p>\n<p>swimming and cycling quite regularly.</p>\n<h3>Agata</h3>\n<p>I have always loved many physical activity and had been involving in a degree of competition.</p>\n<p>I don't like to watch other people play sports, I am not a fan or a spectator.  I love sports can be played indoors or outdoors and by individuals or teams, like tennis.</p>\n<p>But in my opinion I love sports because I love to be an active and healthy woman, in fact I enjoy if I catch the train running, if I win at bowling, if climb a mountain without wheezing and out of breath. </p>\n<p>Even if I have a busy working life, I look for having time for sport and for a healthy lifestyle,  that helps to keep and improve my health and well-being.</p>\n<h3>Mauro, Italy</h3>\n<p>I'd been climbing the mountains for many years. It's a sport that requires skill, experience, strenghts and a very good knowledge of the mountain environment. Now that I'm approaching the 70 years, I rather prefer the rock climbing activity, that also requires skill and preparation but doesnt require the endurance of many hours and days, just few hours and the adrenaline junkies is always guaranteed. Everybody can learn, do and enjoy a thrill by rock climbing.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos </h3>\n<p>I wanted to get peace so I began to practice extreme sports. I began with bungee jumping but it was tired, I had to look for a good place, an old bridge or an abandoned dam in a swamp, then you have to ensure the space around the jumping place for having a safe jump. While you're doing that, people arrive around you. Peace disappears. Well, they had helped me after jump when I realized that with my harness I couldn't release the rope and I stayed hung inside out. </p>\n<p>I had been trying gliding for a year and it’s different: you go into the void, you have a parachute which you don’t want to use. The best is you can navigate from one side to other thinking always the plane has not any engine, if you are in summer, you don’t have problems during the day.</p>\n<p>I am not hooked because you need too much stuff: other plane to lift yours, a ground team to pick up the glider if you land far away… Money</p>\n<p>Better I stay at home.</p>\n<h3>Henry, Hong Kong</h3>\n<p>I am not sure on whether combat sport is one of the extreme sport, but it is as exciting as other extreme sports.</p>\n<p>I first martial art style I practiced was taekwondo.  I had practiced it for 5 to 6 years but eventually I found it was not practical enough because it did not have much training on punching and grappling.  Therefore, I gave it up and started my training in karate and judo in 2011, as well as muay thai in later time.  I am going to have my karate black belt exam soon.</p>\n<p>It is essential for all combat sports learners to engage in sparring for technique improvement.  In addition, it is enjoyable because of the excitement of overcoming strong opponents, like very skillful and well experienced black belt fighters, or giant opponents with nearly 290lbs.  Also, we improve as we put or skills into test and we know what to improve after sparring. </p>\n<p>Continuous training and difficult sparring matches makes me a more courageous, and persistent person.  All in all, it makes me more capable to overcome challenges in daily life.</p>\n<h3>Piero, Italy</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately my job has never allowed  me enough time to perform in the sport I had ever been loving the most: the rock free climbing. Eventually the pension has arrived, but then I was 60 year-old and that became my new limit. Since a few years I prefer to ride the bicycle: that doesn't mean I consider this sport more suitable for senior citizens, but just because I easily make friends who have been training for long.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>hi everybody and respect to question for this week, I have to say that I like some. extreme sports. for example I like the bungee jump. In my country this sport was prohibited several years ago but now in some places as the bridge over the lake sochagota near to Bogotá, some people go to practice it. When I see them to do some stunts while they are in free fall, I feel a huge thrill.</p>\n<p>I would like to jump how they do it but I'm a little wimp. Maybe someday I be able to do it. until now the most extreme that I made was install a camera at a building at the 20 floor. I'd been working for two weeks in that place when one camera installed out  of the building started to fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</strong></p>\n<p>I like sports. When I was younger I used to be a good football player on the weekends. I had a team with my friends. We had been playing football until we started working.</p>\n<h3>Vasyl </h3>\n<p> I like to feel good and such a feeling begins from disciplined day's regime and balanced feeding I suppose. But apart from the fact we have to eat well we must also do something to eat for. If your life stream is mostly inactive perhaps the sport is something that will substitute the hunting and gathering so natural for our ancient ancestors.</p>\n<p>  I have been exercising for three years before I won my first athletics competitions long time ago. Today I do not sports as soon as I became a father and have not too much free time but if I have to reach some place I still would run as Forest from the famous movie.</p>\n<h3>Richard, France</h3>\n<p>I like sports. I always practiced sports for my young age.</p>\n<p>I liked climbing cliffs a few years ago, when I was younger. It was very exciting ! Now I play golf ! It isn’t a extreme sport, it’s very different, but it’s also exciting, because the main is that you are enjoyed.</p>\n<h3>Pawan , Nepal</h3>\n<p>I call myself a sport enthusiast when it comes to cricket. Off and on, you will find me playing it with my friends for fun and enjoyment. Although, I have a huge predilection for the sport, I repent at times for not being a good player. <br/> <br/> When it comes to extreme sport, I rather accept myself as a wimp. If I hadn't had health problems I would've loved to enjoy the thrills it provided. I am galvanized by the audaciousness of men and women enjoying the skydiving, bungee jumping, mount climbing and the like.</p>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>How was that? Ready for some more extreme learning with us? Join us in Session 5 for the next part of our Victorian drama, The Importance of Being Earnest. This time, Algernon secretly goes to visit Cecily. He's pretending to be Jack's younger brother, Ernest. Will he win her heart?</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. Today we're talking about words and phrases that we use to express our attitude to what we're saying or writing.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So two common examples are <strong>fortunately</strong>, which shows I'm pleased, and <strong>I'm afraid, </strong>which shows I'm sorry about something. So let's start by listening to Rob. He's talking about electric cars. Are you a fan of the electric car, Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I'm not a fan of any kind of car actually, Finn. If I had one I would probably consider electric.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Very environmentally considerate of you.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Thank you. And before we hear from Rob, here's a question: What is Rob's attitude towards public transport and bicycles? Here he is:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span><strong>I must admit</strong> I'm not sure about the whole idea of electric cars. I mean <strong>obviously</strong> we need to find alternative forms of energy, but <strong>if you ask me</strong>, reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority. <strong>Ideally</strong> we would all use public transport or bicycles. <strong>Seriously</strong>, I think people should be given tax breaks if they don't own a car! But <strong>of course</strong> that's not going to happen any time soon.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So Rob's attitude is that <strong>ideally</strong> we would all use public transport or bicycles.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Or to put that another way, he thinks it would be ideal if we all used public transport or bicycles. By beginning the sentence with <strong>ideally</strong>, Rob expresses his attitude nicely in just one word. Right. Let's listen for more words and phrases that shows Rob's attitude in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong></span><strong>Rob   <br/></strong><strong>I must admit</strong> I'm not sure about the whole idea of electric cars. I mean <strong>obviously</strong> we need to find alternative forms of energy, but <strong>if you ask me,</strong> reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So he begins with the phrase <strong>I must admit</strong>... Now what does that tell us? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we usually use that expression when we're going to say something that might be unpopular. Perhaps we're a little embarrassed to say it.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, Rob knows that a lot of people are keen on the idea of electric cars, but he's going to say something different.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Then Rob used the word <strong>obviously</strong>. People use <strong>obviously</strong> to show that an idea is easy to see or understand.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And by using it here, Rob means that the need for alternative forms of energy is clear to him, even though he has other ideas on the subject too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly. Because he then said <strong>if you ask me</strong>, reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So this phrase:<strong> if you ask me - </strong>it's like<strong> in my opinion</strong>, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It is, but it tells us more about the speaker's attitude. It's less direct than <strong>in my opinion</strong>, and it shows that Rob realises that other people might disagree. Let's have another clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Rob<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Seriously</strong>, I think people should be given tax breaks if they don't own a car! </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Seriously.</strong> Now why does he use that word here?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Seriously</strong> shows that Rob knows that his idea might sound like a joke to some people. But he wants to make it clear that it's not a joke.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Oh yes, people often use it when they have been joking and they want to start being serious, don't they?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they do. Right, listen again:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>But <strong>of course</strong> that's not going to happen any time soon.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, <strong>of course</strong> is a very familiar expression. Now here Rob uses it to show his understanding of the real situation. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Does it also sound slightly critical of the government?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, I think it does. He's not expecting any new government policies that will change the situation on the roads.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we're talking about words and phrases that show attitude. <strong>Obviously,</strong> they are very important for expressing yourself and understanding what other people mean!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But <strong>I'm afraid</strong> they can be tricky to define in a dictionary, can't they, Finn?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they can. In fact you can often only understand their real meaning from the context that they are in.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And it's nearly the end of the show so obviously it's time for a quiz! So question one: Which is correct? a) I must admit I haven't done much work today or b) If you ask me, I haven't done much work today.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's a) <strong>I must admit</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Correct. Good. Now question two: a) Ideally, the weather will affect our plans for the day or b) Obviously, the weather will affect our plans for the day.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And that one is b) <strong>obviously</strong>.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Correct. And question three: a) OK, but seriously, what do you really think? b) OK, but of course, what do you really think? </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>And this time it's a) <strong>seriously</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes it is. And well done if you got those right at home.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And now, here's a game you can play with a friend to help you practise these words and phrases. Have a conversation with them and try to use as many of these words and phrases as you can. Give yourself a point each time you manage to do it.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's all we got time for and there's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

Maybe meet up with friends, read a book or listen to music? Some people prefer retail therapy! They go shopping to make themselves feel better. Read this description of such an experience. </p>\n<p><strong>Retail therapy #1</strong><br>\"The other day I was feeling a bit miserable. I decided to go shopping to cheer myself up. At the time I was out I bought some new shoes. I bought a jacket. I bought lots of other bits and pieces. I didn't find anything I really liked. I didn't find anything I really wanted. I began to feel better which surprised me. The reason I began to feel better was I wasn't stuck in the house feeling sorry for myself.\"</br></p>\n<p>This is a perfectly grammatically correct paragraph. However, it's not very natural. There are too many short sentences, lots of repetition of the pronoun <strong>I</strong> which means it doesn't flow. It is also very impersonal. Now let's rewrite it - this time, with some conjunctions.</p>\n<p><strong>Retail therapy #2</strong><br/>\"The other day I was feeling a bit miserable <strong>so</strong> I decided to go shopping to cheer myself up. <strong>While</strong> I was out I bought some new shoes <strong>and</strong> a jacket <strong>and</strong> lots of other bits and pieces <strong>but</strong> I didn’t find anything I really liked. <strong>Even though</strong> I didn’t find what I wanted, I began to feel better <strong>because</strong> I wasn’t stuck in the house feeling sorry for myself.\"</p>\n<p>The conjunctions link sentences and ideas together. This helps the text to flow more naturally and adds personality. Let's look at how they work.</p>\n<p><strong>So </strong>links two ideas. One idea follows on as a result or consequence of another one.<br/><em>I was hungry <strong>so</strong> I had a sandwich.</em></p>\n<p><strong>While </strong>links an action with the time when it took place.<br/><em>He learned to dive <strong>while</strong> he was at university.</em></p>\n<p><strong>And </strong>links two similar ideas or actions.<br/><em>She went to the cinema <strong>and</strong> the theatre on the same day.<br/></em><strong><br/>But </strong>introduces a contrast, often indicating something you might expect to happen, didn't.<br/><em>She went to the cinema <strong>but</strong> she didn't get popcorn.<br/></em><strong><br/>Even though </strong>is used to express that it is surprising that something has happened given what else has been said.<br/><em><strong>Even though</strong> she got a good promotion, she didn't get a pay rise.<br/></em><em><strong><br/></strong></em><strong>Because </strong>introduces a reason for something.<br/><em>I failed my driving test <strong>because</strong> I crashed into a police car.</em></p>\n<h3>To do </h3>\n<p>Now it's your turn. In the exercise you have the same list of conjunctions for each question - but which one is the most suitable?</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done on the quiz! Now for some extremely informal spoken discourse words, click on to the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Like</h3>\n<p><strong>Discourse markers</strong> come in many forms. Some are used for <strong>linking</strong> and <strong>organising</strong> ideas, some are used more in written English and some are only used in spoken English.</p>\n<p><strong>Like</strong> is one that is common in spoken English.</p>\n<p>You might think that you know the meaning of the word <strong>like</strong>. It's a verb that means <strong>enjoy</strong>, isn't it? I <strong>like</strong> coffee. Or maybe it's a preposition that means <strong>similar to</strong>? She looks <strong>like</strong> her mother. Of course we also use it when we want something: I'd <strong>like</strong> a cheese sandwich, please.</p>\n<p>But what do you make of <strong>l</strong><strong>ike </strong>in this example?</p>\n<p>She was <strong>like</strong> \"You can't come in,\" and I was <strong>like</strong> \"Oh yes I can, I'm over eighteen,\" then she was <strong>like</strong> \"You gotta be 21 to come in here.\" That was <strong>like</strong> so unfair.</p>\n<p>Confused? Read on and all will be explained!</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>She was like, you know, well, whatever!</h3>\n<p>One very common filler in modern spoken English is the word <strong>like</strong>.</p>\n<p>It can be used to emphasise something:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>There were <strong>like</strong> 3,000 people there, it was amazing. = </em><strong>Like </strong>emphasises the large number of people.</li>\n<li><em>We didn't get home until <strong>like</strong> 3 o'clock in the morning! = </em><strong>Like </strong>emphasises how late it was.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can be used when we are thinking about what we are going to say next and need a little time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"I'm going to ... <strong>like</strong> ... I want to think about the job, before I accept it.\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In extremely informal speech it's another way of reporting what someone has said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>She was <strong>like</strong> \"he's my boyfriend\" and I was <strong>like</strong> \"no he's not\" and she was <strong>like</strong> \"whatever!\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>You know</h3>\n<p><strong>You know </strong>is another phrase which in spoken English is used in a similar way to like. It can emphasise something or give thinking time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I was, <strong>you know</strong>, really upset when she split up with me.</em></li>\n<li><em>I was, <strong>you know</strong>, going down the shops when,<strong> you know</strong>, I realised I'd left my keys at home. Gutted. </em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Very important</h3>\n<p>You might hear these uses of <strong>like </strong>and <strong>you know</strong> in popular films or television programmes. They<strong> </strong>are only common in spoken English and only then in particular groups of young people or teenagers, so don't use them in formal or academic writing! </p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Just for fun, try this exercise. Decide whether the sentences are only suitable in spoken English or also fine to use in formal written English.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session on discourse markers.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, <strong>Callum</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me, <strong>Catherine</strong>. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>           <br/>In this programme we’re talking about adverbs and where they should go. Catherine, remind us what adverbs are.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine          <br/></strong>Certainly Callum. Adverbs are words or phrases that we use to give more information about verbs, adjectives or other adverbs. We use them to express how someone does something or how something happens. </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>In today’s programme we’re going to focus on how they are used with verbs. Listen out for the adverbs <strong>usually</strong>, <strong>really</strong>, <strong>hardly</strong> and <strong>ever</strong>. Here’s Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work. I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work.<br/>I don’t <strong>really</strong> like cheese. I don’t <strong>really</strong> like cheese.<br/>I can <strong>hardly</strong> believe what happened at the concert. I can <strong>hardly</strong> believe what happened at the concert.<br/>Have you <strong>ever</strong> been to Scotland? Have you <strong>ever</strong> been to Scotland?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Now, let’s look more closely at where to put the adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Adverbs can usually be placed in one of three positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>The first position is at the very beginning of the sentence, before the subject.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>Usually</strong> I drive to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The second position is before the main verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And the third position is after the direct object or complement of the verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I drive to work <strong>usually</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT         <br/></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Today we’re talking about where to put adverbs when we are using them to give more information about verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We’ve seen that there are three positions where adverbs typically go.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So is it the case that you can put any adverb in any of these positions?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Callum, if it was that simple, it would be fantastic. Many adverbs can indeed go in any of these positions, depending on style and context.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I feel there is a 'but’ coming.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But…</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Ah, there it is…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But that’s not always the case. Some adverbs can’t go in certain places and some are more common in particular positions than others.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And we also have to consider modals and other auxiliaries, questions and negatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We do. So let’s start with the verb <strong>to be</strong><em>. </em>When the verb <strong>to be </strong>is the main verb of a sentence, we usually put adverbs immediately after the verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He’s <strong>always</strong> on time.<br/>I was <strong>never</strong> happy at school.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>When there is more than one part to the verb, where does the adverb go?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If there is an auxiliary such as have or has in the present perfect or a modal like can, will, should and so on, the adverb usually goes after the auxiliary and before the main verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You can <strong>never</strong> predict what mood he is going to be in.<br/>I’ve <strong>rarely</strong> seen him angry.<br/>I will <strong>always</strong> love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'll always love you Finn. The same is true in negative sentences. The adverb will come after the negative and before the main verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I’ve <strong>never</strong> visited Iceland. I’ve <strong>never</strong> visited Iceland.<br/>He can’t <strong>even</strong> make a cup of tea. He can’t <strong>even</strong> make a cup of tea.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>What about questions?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The same is true there. The adverb comes after the question word or auxiliary and before the main verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Do you <strong>still</strong> live in the same city? Do you <strong>still</strong> live in the same city?<br/>Would you <strong>really</strong> like me to come and stay? Would you <strong>really</strong> like me to come and stay?<br/>Have you <strong>ever</strong> thought about emigrating? Have you <strong>ever</strong> thought about emigrating?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Now, are there any places where you can't put an adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There are. Adverbs don’t go between a main verb and its direct object. So for example could I say: I play very well tennis?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Well you could say it, but it wouldn’t be right.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK then, how about this? I play tennis very well.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That’s correct, though only grammatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Well actually you play tennis awfully!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's true actually Callum, yep.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>We’re nearly at the end of today’s programme, just time to take our quick quiz on this topic.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You’re going to hear some sentences and you need to decide if the adverbs are in the correct place. Here’s the first one</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You always must remember to lock the door when you leave. You always must remember to lock the door when you leave.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>This one is…. not right. The adverb <strong><em>always</em></strong> should come after the modal ‘must’ and before the main verb ‘remember’. Here’s the next one.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I have never learned a foreign language. I have never learned a foreign language.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>This is… correct. The adverb, in this case <strong>never</strong> comes between the auxiliary ‘have’ and the main verb ‘learned’.  And the final sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She rarely is late.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>This is… not correct. The adverb <strong>rarely </strong>should come after the verb ‘to be’.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So that’s our introduction to the position of adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Do check our website bbclearningenglish.com for more information on this subject.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And do join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar</p>\n<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Goodbye</p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Adverbs: a reminder</h3>\n<p>As we're sure you remember, one thing adverbs do is tell us about verbs. They can tell us about <strong>how</strong> we do the things that we do. For example, if you ride a bike, how do you ride?</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>See if you can spot the adverbs in these sentences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I always ride carefully.</em></li>\n<li><em>I ride as fast as I can.</em></li>\n<li><em>I never ride a bike - it's too dangerous.</em></li>\n<li><em>I really like to ride slowly.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The adverbs are: <strong>always</strong>, <strong>as fast as I can</strong> (adverbs aren't always a single word: they can be phrases too), <strong>never</strong>, <strong>too</strong>, <strong>really </strong>and <strong>slowly</strong><em>. </em>Well done if you identified all of those.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Where do adverbs go with verbs?</h3>\n<p>Where we put adverbs in a sentence depends a lot on the kind of adverb, the style and the context. Generally though, there are three positions where it's possible to put an adverb in relation to a verb.</p>\n<p><strong>First position:</strong> before the subject. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Carefully</strong> he opened the package.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Second position: </strong> before the main verb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He <strong>carefully </strong>opened the package.</em> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Third position: </strong>after the verb or after the verb and its direct object or clause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He opened the package <strong>carefully</strong>.</em> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What about the verb 'to be'?</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">When the verb <strong>to be </strong>is the main verb of a sentence, we usually put adverbs <strong>immediately after</strong> the verb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He’s <strong>always</strong> on time.</em></li>\n<li><em>I was <strong>never</strong> happy at school.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Where you can't put an adverb</h3>\n<p>One place you should <strong>never</strong> put an adverb is between a verb and its direct object:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He opened <strong>carefully</strong> the package. </em>(This sentence is not correct.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Another place we <strong>don’t</strong> put an adverb is between a verb and a gerund or infinitive with 'to'.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He started cycling <strong>professionally</strong> in 2011.</em> (Correct)</li>\n<li><em>He started <strong>professionally</strong> cycling in 2011. </em>(Not correct)</li>\n<li><em>I’d like to sit down <strong>again</strong>.</em> (Correct)</li>\n<li><em>I’d like <strong>again</strong> to sit down. </em>(Not correct)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>To see if you've got the idea so far, try the quiz. You just have to look at each sentence and decide if the adverb or adverbs are in the correct place. </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now you've finished this page, head on to the next activity for more information about adverbs - and another quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Second position adverbs when the verb has an auxiliary</h3>\n<p>In many verb forms the verb has different elements. For example, in the present perfect we have the auxiliary <strong>have/has </strong>followed by the<strong> past participle </strong>of the main verb. </p>\n<p>When we use an adverb in the <strong>second position</strong>, we put it <strong>after the first auxiliary and before the main verb.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I'<strong>ve rarely seen</strong> him so angry.</em></li>\n<li><em>He'<strong>d already accepted</strong> the job before learning he would have to move overseas.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What about modals and second position adverbs?</h3>\n<p>Modals are words like <strong>can, could, shall, should, may, might, must, will </strong>and<strong> would. </strong>They work like auxilaries, so adverbs go <strong>after the modal and before the main verb.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You <strong>should never go</strong> <strong>out</strong> without your keys.</em></li>\n<li><em>I <strong>will always love</strong> you.</em></li>\n<li><em>You <strong>can definitely rely</strong> on me.</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Second position adverbs and questions</h3>\n<p>When we make a question we put the adverb <strong>after the question word and between the subject and the main verb.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Have you ever tried</strong> eating snails?</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Would you really like</strong> it if I came to stay?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What about negatives?</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">In negative sentences put the adverb <strong>after the auxiliary/modal and negative word and before the main verb.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>I<strong> don’t usually like</strong> going out on weeknights.</em></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>They <strong>won’t always let</strong> you in after midnight.</em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"GrammarBank\">To do</h3>\n<p>Have a go at this little quiz. I'm sure you won't find it too difficult. Just follow the rules we've covered.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now you've finshed this page, why not listen to Callum, Catherine and Finn in 6 Minute Grammar. In this programme they're talking about - you guessed it: adverbs.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Adverb position 1</h3>\n<p>Callum and Catherine, with Finn's help, talk about the three positions where adverbs usually go when used with verbs.

Did you choose this dish because it was healthy, cheap or because it was… well, just very tasty? Are you a <strong>fussy eater</strong> or an adventurous <strong>gourmet</strong>?

While you're reading, see if you can work out which of the food trends it describes is the oldest. The answer is at the bottom of the article.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong><span><span>Part 1<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Satay chicken pizza might have made my <strong>purist</strong> Italian grandmother squeeze her tomatoes in anger and <strong>turn her nose up </strong>in disgust, but this marriage of tastes is perfectly fine in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. It's part of what we call 'fusion cuisine'. Chef and food writer Ching-He Huang, who presented a series on Chinese Food for the BBC, is a fan of the movement. \"Fusion has been happening for centuries, for as long as people have travelled,\" she says. \"You would take your comfort food, noodles, perhaps, with you, and then use whatever you could find locally to make it taste of home. But with the internet, and global travel, the exchange of ideas makes the process much faster.\"</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 2<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Wolfgang Puck is seen by many as one of the chefs who made 'fusion' elegant. He <strong>cut his teeth</strong> in his native Vienna and <strong>made a name for himself</strong> when he opened his own restaurant in Los Angeles in the 70s. This European <strong>delved into</strong> Asian cuisine and became one of the first in a long line of celebrity chefs. He said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal that initially he got negative responses from traditional American-Chinese restaurant owners but he is not <strong>bitter</strong>. \"I believe <strong>authenticity</strong> is about evolution, not repeating your grandmother's recipe,\" he explains. \"Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there are only so many notes or colours, there are only so many flavours – it's how you combine them that sets you apart.\"</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 3<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>The act of cooking food can make Puck feel like an artist, and it can also wake up the mad scientist in some of his <strong>peers</strong>. Londoner Heston Blumenthal became well-known for <strong>mastering</strong> what's known as 'molecular gastronomy'. His kitchen is more of a lab, in which he uses <strong>dry ice</strong>, <strong>centrifuge machines</strong> and <strong>Petri dishes</strong>. Items on his menu are said to involve dozens of ingredients, and it includes <strong>delicacies</strong> such as snail porridge and bacon and egg ice cream. Blumenthal believes that eating uses all five senses, which send messages to the brain where the memory helps us to decide if we like a particular food or not.

It was founded by her countryman Carlo Petrini in the 1980s and it seeks to preserve regional cuisine and the use of ingredients that are grown locally. The movement is a reaction against the popularisation of fast food, industrial food production and globalisation.

That's it for me: I'm going to the coffee shop around the corner to get myself a 'cronut'! What’s a cronut? Well, that's what you have when you marry a French croissant with an American doughnut. A feast of calories that will excite my palate and then live on in my hips.

Today I'm going to try and talk you through making my favourite dish – a traditional full English breakfast – or what we sometimes call a fry-up – can you guess why we call it that? Well maybe you will when you listen to this!</p>\n<p>So we've got to have some meat in a fry-up so I'll start with my sausages so I'm going to put those in the frying pan <em>carefully</em> – the cooking oil's quite hot so you can already hear them <strong>sizzling</strong> away – and sounding delicious as well. We sometimes call them bangers simply because they '<strong>bang</strong>' and '<strong>pop</strong>' when they're cooking. Like that!</p>\n<p>And let's <em>quickly</em> stick in the bacon too – trying not to <strong>splatter</strong> myself with hot cooking oil – I should be wearing an apron - there it goes <strong>crackling</strong> away in the pan. Listen to that! It makes your mouth water, doesn't it?</p>\n<p>Now a fry-up <em>usually</em> includes baked beans – so I have a bowl here to heat some up – I'll just <strong>plop</strong> the beans in there and heat them in the microwave - stirring them <em>occasionally</em> so they don't burn.</p>\n<p>Ah, we can't forget the eggs so in another frying pan, I'm just going to <em>gently </em><strong>crack</strong> open an egg and fry that too – lovely!</p>\n<p>And I need a few mushrooms, so I'm going to <strong>chop</strong> those up into small slices -  and fry those up in the pan too.</p>\n<p>Of course, I need some toast to accompany my breakfast, so I'm going to <strong>slice</strong> some bread with the bread knife – put that in the toaster – and hopefully when it <strong>pops</strong> up it will be nice and <strong>crunchy</strong> and I can smother it in butter.</p>\n<p>Ah, there's the <strong>ping</strong> of the microwave so the beans are ready now, let's get those out.</p>\n<p>And finally, you've always got to have a big mug of steaming hot tea to <strong>slurp</strong>  -  something to wash down all that lovely greasy food. Cooking is thirsty work.</p>\n<p>OK the toast has popped up so I'm about ready to serve up and <strong>munch</strong> on all this tasty food. I just need to put it on the plate now and smother it all with tomato ketchup and <strong>sprinkle</strong> on some salt. Now it's time <strong>chomp</strong> away and <strong>gulp</strong> down my tea –  ahhh!</p>\n<p>So that's my perfect meal - I'm sorry you're not here to join me.</p> </div>",

I'm Neil…</br></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And I'm Catherine. And it's very good to see you back at work today, Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thanks, it's nice to be back. I hate being off sick.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We've missed you... we have missed you. And there has been a lot of sickness in the office this week, and <strong>sickness</strong> is one of the words that we're looking at in today's show.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Today we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-ness</strong> and <strong>-ity</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>In the world of vocabulary, suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word. They can tell you what type of word it is. The suffix <strong>-ness</strong>, spelt<strong> n-e-s-s</strong>, at the end of the word <strong>sickness</strong> tells you that the word is a noun, which comes from the adjective <strong>sick</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this programme we'll give you lots more examples of words with the suffix <strong>-ness</strong> and also we'll find about the suffix <strong>-ity</strong>, spelt <strong>i-t-y</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. And we'll have a quiz...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary. So let's get started by hearing from Arjuna. And he's talking about how he feels about being a nurse.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>While you listen, think about this question: How does Arjuna often feel at the end of the day?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Arjuna<br/></strong>I have a lot of <strong>responsibility</strong>. Sometimes it's upsetting, like telling someone there's a <strong>possibility</strong> they have a serious <strong>illness</strong>. The hours are long and <strong>tiredness</strong> can be a problem at the end of the day. But the rewards are there too, like the <strong>happiness</strong> of a mother holding her newborn baby. And of course there are the cards and gifts - I'm always touched by the <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>generosity</strong> of the patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So we asked you: How does Arjuna feel at the end of the day?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And the answer is: he feels tired. In fact, he says that '<strong>tiredness</strong> can be a problem'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The word <strong>tiredness</strong> comes from the adjective <strong>tired</strong>. Nouns with the suffix <strong>–ness</strong>, spelt <strong>n-e-s-s</strong>, like <strong>tiredness</strong>, describe the feeling or state of the original adjective.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>tired – ness </strong>is the feeling of being tired.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly.<strong> Ill – ness</strong> is the state of being ill. <strong>Sick – ness</strong>, which we heard at the start of the programme, is the state of being <strong>sick</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Poor you, Neil. Let's hear some more examples of this suffix.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Arjuna<br/></strong>But the rewards are there too, like the <strong>happiness</strong> of a mother holding her newborn baby. And of course there are the cards and gifts - I'm always touched by the <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>generosity</strong> of the patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we had <strong>happiness</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...from the adjective <strong>happy</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And <strong>kindness</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...from the adjective <strong>kind</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>In <strong>kindness</strong>, the suffix <strong>-ness</strong> makes a noun that is a quality. The suffix <strong>-ity</strong>, spelt<strong> i-t-y</strong>, which we heard in the word <strong>generosity </strong>there, also changes an adjective into a quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Generosity</strong> comes from the adjective generous. It means: the willingness to give things.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And Arjuna thinks his patients are generous because they give the nurses cards and gifts. Let's hear some more words with the suffix <strong>-ity</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Arjuna<br/></strong>I have a lot of <strong>responsibility</strong>. Sometimes it's upsetting, like telling someone there's a <strong>possibility</strong> they have a serious <strong>illness</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We had <strong>responsibility</strong>, which comes from the adjective<strong> responsible</strong>. It means: being in charge of someone or something, or making sure certain things happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We also heard <strong>possibility</strong>, which comes from the adjective<strong> possible</strong> and means that something might happen.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>ness </strong>and<strong> -ity</strong>, which change adjectives into nouns.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Great. Now it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one. Mr Smith will not be attending the meeting, due to a) illity  b) illness  c) ill.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is b)<strong> illness</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number two. To succeed in high-level management, you have to accept a lot of a) responsibleness  b) responsity  c) responsibility. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is c) <strong>responsibility</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three. Listening to 6 Minute Vocabulary whilst drinking a glass of wine at the end of the day brings me a lot of a) happiness  b) happity  c) happinessity.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>happiness</strong>, of course!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>That's right. And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: when you come across a word that you don't know, look to see if you can work out the root of the word - if there is a prefix or a suffix that you know, it will help you to understand the meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

I didn’t realise it was so late, we have to go.</em></p>\n<p>Goodness = the state or condition of being morally good.</p>\n<p><em>His <strong>goodness</strong> was only really known by his closest family and friends.</em></p>\n<p>There is a famous line in the 1932 film Night after Night. The actress Mae West hands her coat to an attendant at a club. The attendant comments on her jewellery:</p>\n<p><em>“<strong>Goodness</strong>! What beautiful diamonds.”</em></p>\n<p> The reply:</p>\n<p><em>“<strong>Goodness</strong> had nothing to do with it.\"</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Suffixes: -ness and -ity</h3>\n<p>There are many different suffixes. In 6 Minute Vocabulary you heard Catherine and Neil talking about <strong>ness</strong> and <strong>ity</strong>.</p>\n<p>Suffixes are really useful things that we can use to build vocabulary. They are added to the end of other words and one thing they can do is to change an adjective into a noun. </p>\n<p><em>I feel <strong>ill</strong>.</em> (adjective)</p>\n<p><em>He's off school with an unusual ill<strong>ness</strong>. </em>(noun)</p>\n<p><em>His personality was really <strong>complex</strong></em>.(adjective)</p>\n<p>I admire the <em>complex</em><strong><em>ity</em></strong> of this design. (noun)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here are some other common adjectives that can use the suffix <strong>ness:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Dark, good, kind, cold, happy, sad, weak, ready, tidy, forgetful, attentive, aware, conscious, late, lonely</em></strong></p>\n<p>When the adjective ends in -y, the 'y' changes to 'i' before adding <strong>ness</strong>.</p>\n<p>happy - happ<strong>iness</strong><br>ready - read<strong>iness</strong><br/>tidy - tid<strong>iness</strong><br/>lonely - lonl<strong>iness</strong></br></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here are some other common adjectives that use the suffix <strong>ity: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>possible</strong>, <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>responsible</strong>, <strong>complex</strong>, <strong>hilarious</strong>, <strong>scarce</strong>, <strong>equal, able</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the adjective ends in <strong>ble</strong>, <strong>le </strong>changes to <strong>il</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p>possible<strong> - </strong>possib<strong>ility<br/></strong>able - ab<strong>ility<br/></strong>responsible - responsib<strong>ility</strong></p>\n<p>Note these other irregular spellings:</p>\n<p>hilarious - hilar<strong>ity</strong><br/>scarce - scarc<strong>ity</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Now try a quiz where you have to decide which word best completes each sentence. You'll need to think about whether the answer is a noun, adjective or adverb and if it has the right suffix.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Congratulations on finishing the quiz. In the next activity we look at the useful suffix <strong>ish</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Suffix: ish</h3>\n<p><strong>Ish</strong> is a very versatile and descriptive <strong>suffix</strong>. It has a number of different meanings.</p>\n<h3>Connected to a particular country or language</h3>\n<p><em>Their family is a real United Nations; the mother is <strong>English</strong>, the father is <strong>Swedish</strong> and because they were born in Barcelona, the children also have <strong>Spanish</strong> nationality.</em></p>\n<p><strong>But be careful</strong>, not all nationalities have <strong>ish </strong>as a suffix. Other suffixes are used for some nationalities, for example: Cuba - <strong>Cuban</strong>, Brazil - <strong>Brazilian</strong>, Japan - <strong>Japanese</strong></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\"><br>Approximately</br></strong></p>\n<p>When we use <strong>ish</strong> with a number it has the meaning of <strong>approximately</strong><strong>, about that number, around then</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>\"How old would you say she was?\"</em><strong> </strong> \"<em>I don't know, <strong>thirtyish</strong> maybe.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"When will you be home?\" \"I'm not sure, <strong>twoish</strong> I guess, depending on traffic.\"</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Slightly, not quite, almost, a little bit like</h3>\n<p>This use of <strong>ish</strong> is frequently used with descriptions when the person or thing we are describing does not exactly match a regular adjective.</p>\n<p><em>\"What does she look like?\"<br/></em><em>\"You can't miss her. She's <strong>tallish</strong> with <strong>reddish</strong> hair.\" </em></p>\n<p><em>I can't afford a brand new car, but I am looking for something <strong>newish</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>You can use <strong>ish</strong> with just about any adjective to modify it slightly.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\"><br/>Having the quality of, being like a ..., behaving like a ...</strong></p>\n<p>When we use <strong>ish </strong>in this way it changes a noun into an adjective. It's often used when being negative about someone, but not always.</p>\n<p><em>His behaviour was so <strong>childish</strong> at the party. He just wanted to be the centre of attention.</em></p>\n<p><em>I think it was <strong>foolish</strong> of him to spend so much money on a boat. He doesn't even like the water.</em></p>\n<p><em>It was a very <strong>amateurish </strong>production. I was expecting something better from that theatre company.</em></p>\n<p><em>I wish I were as <strong>stylish</strong> as she is.</em></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\"><br/>A unique suffix</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike any other suffix, in spoken English, <strong>ish</strong> can be used as a word and a sentence all by itself. If you are answering a question and your response is not definite, you can use <strong>ish </strong>by itself.<strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Are you hungry?\" \"<strong>Ish</strong>.\" = </em>I'm a little bit hungry, but not really hungry.</p>\n<p><em>\"Did you like the film?\" \"</em><em><strong>Ish</strong></em><em>.</em><em>\"</em> = It was O.K. It's not my favourite film but it passed the time.</p>\n<p><em>\"How was the date? Did you like him?\" \"<strong>Ish</strong>.</em><em>\"</em> = I'm not sure, I would definitely think about going on another date though.</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Now, why not try a quiz about <strong>ish</strong>. It's exciting, well, excitingish.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>In the next session we learn about using <strong>the definite article with abstract uncountable nouns</strong>. There are some exercises too and you can join Callum and Catherine for 6 Minute Grammar.</p></div>",

To start with, let's just remind everyone about the terms we're using. First, there's the definite article. What's that, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong><strong>The</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum        <br/></strong>The what?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Just <strong>the</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Just the what?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You're doing this on purpose, aren't you Callum? The definite article is the word <strong>the</strong>. Articles are used before nouns.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Today's topic is using <strong>the</strong> with abstract uncountable nouns. Tell us about those.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now, before I get to the abstract part, let's just remind everybody about uncountable nouns, which you might also hear described as mass nouns. These are nouns that, as the name suggests, you can't count. They have no plural form. Words like air, water, cheese, money...</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Wait a minute...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong><br/>Did you say money?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Did you say you can't count money?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. You can't count money, at least not grammatically. You can't count money in the same way as you can count, for example, chairs. Because, when you count chairs, you can just give a number. How many chairs are there? Three, ten, 2,150. But if I ask you Callum how much money you have in your pocket, what would you say?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>OK, well, let me see. I've got five, ten... I've got £15. So I can count money, surely?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, you've got <strong>15 pounds</strong>. But you haven't got <strong>15 moneys</strong>. So, pounds are countable, money isn't. We are counting the pounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I see, and what are abstract uncountable nouns then?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, before we go to abstract, let's first talk about the concrete ones. Concrete uncountable nouns are things that you can physically experience, that's things that you can touch, see, hear, smell or taste. But abstract nouns don't refer to these physical things. Abstract nouns refer to ideas, feelings, emotions, qualities and concepts. So, things like: <strong>love</strong>, <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>happiness</strong>, <strong>bravery</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>enthusiasm</strong> and <strong>childhood.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>But I'm sure I experienced <strong>childhood</strong>. It seemed pretty real to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, because we describe something as abstract, it doesn't mean it isn't real. You certainly were a child Callum at some time, whenever that was. But the period of time when you were a child... all the experiences that you had when you were growing up... aren't physical things. Together they make an idea or a concept that we call <strong>childhood</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Today we're looking at using the definite article with abstract uncountable nouns. We've defined our terms, so now let's look at how these two go together. Catherine, can we use <strong>the </strong>with abstract uncountable nouns?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, Callum, it depends on the context. If we are talking about something in general, we don't use the definite article. Here's Finn, with an example.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It can be difficult to find <strong>happiness.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The abstract noun there is <strong>happiness</strong>. Here we're talking about <strong>happiness</strong> in general, we don't use the definite article. Now compare that use of <strong>happiness</strong>, with this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I can't express <strong>the happiness</strong> that I felt when my son was born.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now in this case, are we talking about <strong>happiness</strong> in general?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>No, we're talking about a specific time, a particular moment when there was <strong>happiness</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, so in this case, because it is referring to a particular time we do need to use <strong>the definite article</strong>. Note that after the noun <strong>the happiness </strong>there is a phrase that points to the exact time being described. And in this case the phrase is:</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That I felt when my son was born.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And that phrase is a defining relative clause. When there is a defining relative clause following an abstract uncountable noun, the chances are the noun will have the definite article in front of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So we know that the definite article <strong>the </strong>is used with abstract uncountable nouns when we are talking about a specific example of that noun.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And when we are talking about that noun in general, we don't use any article.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I think it's time for a little quiz. Listen to each sentence and decide if the use of the article is correct or not. Finn, number one please.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I've got a lot of the ambition.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that one is... not correct. <strong>Ambition</strong> is the noun but it shouldn't have the definite article. Next one please, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He had the confidence that is needed to sing in public.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That is correct. The noun is <strong>confidence</strong> and as the particular example of confidence is defined, we do need <strong>the</strong>. Last question, please.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Love is all you need.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Of course, that one is correct. <strong>Love</strong> is the noun and it refers to the idea of love in general so no definite article. Well done if you got all those right.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That's all from us today, there's more about this topic on our website <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Countable and uncountable nouns</h3>\n<p>Some nouns can be counted, others can't. Now, what does that mean?</p>\n<p>Think of <strong>a pen</strong>. The noun is <strong>pen</strong>, it has a <strong>plural form</strong> <strong>pens</strong>. If you want to say <strong>how many</strong> pens there are, you can just give a number as an answer:</p>\n<p><em>\"How many pens do you need for the class?\" \"Three or four should be enough.\"</em></p>\n<p>You can imagine each of these nouns as individual items.</p>\n<p>Now think of <strong>air</strong>? Firstly, notice that there is <strong>no article </strong>before it.</p>\n<p>In its most common use, referring to what we breathe, it <strong>doesn't have a plural form </strong>either. <strong>Air</strong> is all around us, we don't see it as an individual item. We<strong> can't count air</strong>.</p>\n<p>With nouns like <strong>pen </strong>and <strong>air</strong>, it's quite easy to understand if they are countable or uncountable. It's not always so easy though.</p>\n<p>What about <strong>cheese</strong>?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Cheese or cheeses?</h3>\n<p>Some nouns are usually uncountable, like <strong>furniture</strong>, <strong>accommodation</strong>, <strong>music </strong>and<strong> luggage</strong>. Some are<strong> </strong>usually countable, like <strong>chair</strong>, <strong>room</strong>, <strong>song </strong>and <strong>suitcase</strong>. Most nouns, though, can be either countable or uncountable. It doesn't depend on the noun but on the context, on how it is being viewed. </p>\n<p>For example, many nouns for food and drink items such as <strong>cheese</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, <strong>milk</strong>,<strong> rice</strong>,<strong> sugar </strong>and<strong> butter </strong>are normally regarded as uncountable nouns. Nouns like these however can also be <strong>countable</strong>, particularly when we think of them as different kinds or varieties of a product.</p>\n<p><em>These days supermarkets sell <strong>many</strong> different <strong>cheeses</strong>.<strong><br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Demarara, muscovado and caster are some of the different <strong>sugars</strong> we can use when baking.</em></p>\n<h3>Apple or apples?</h3>\n<p>Fruit and vegetables are normally regarded as being countable as we see them as individual items. </p>\n<p><em>We need to get <strong>some</strong></em><strong> apples</strong> = Countable</p>\n<p>If, however, someone has one apple and is offering you a piece of it, the noun apple becomes <strong>uncountable</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Would you like <strong>some apple</strong>? = </em>Uncountable</p>\n<h3>Uncountable or countable: does it matter?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Countable and uncountable nouns have different grammar and are used with different words.</p>\n<p><strong>Countable nouns</strong> can have plural forms. They can be used with the indefinite article.</p>\n<p><strong>Uncountable nouns</strong> are normally used with singular forms and can't be used with the indefinite article.</p>\n<h3>Words and phrases that go with countable nouns</h3>\n<p><strong>many, a few, a number (of), several, fewer</strong></p>\n<p>Words and phrases that go with uncountable nouns:</p>\n<p><strong>much, a little, a bit (of), a great deal of, less, amount</strong></p>\n<p>Words and phrases that go with both countable and uncountable nouns:</p>\n<p><strong>no, none, some, any, a lot (of), plenty (of), lots of, more, quantity</strong></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now why not try a little quiz? All you have to decide is if the noun is countable or uncountable. Easy?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now that we've refreshed <strong>countable and uncountable</strong> nouns, let's step deeper into the subject. The next activity explains <strong>abstract uncountable nouns</strong> and how they are used with <strong>the definite article</strong>. I bet you can hardly control your <strong>excitement</strong>! Oh look, there's one right there - <strong>excitement</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Abstract uncountable nouns</h3>\n<p>Nouns like coffee, pens, wine, chairs, glasses, furniture and music refer to what we can experience with our senses. They are things we can touch, taste, smell, hear or see. These are sometimes called <strong>concrete nouns</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are other nouns which refer to things that can't be physically experienced. Things like ideas, emotions, qualities and concepts. Here are some examples of these words:</p>\n<p><strong>Love, fun, happiness, bravery, patience, enthusiasm, childhood</strong></p>\n<p>These are called <strong>abstract nouns</strong> and they are generally <strong>uncountable</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>General and specific statement and the definite article</h3>\n<p>Now, compare these two sentences using the <strong>abstract uncountable noun happiness</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Money can't buy you <strong>happiness</strong>.</em></li>\n<li><em>I can't express <strong>the happiness</strong> I felt when my child was born.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second sentence has the definite article <strong>the </strong>before the noun. Can you work out why? Here are some more examples to help you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Enthusiasm </strong>is important to progress in any job.</em></li>\n<li><em>You can really see <strong>the enthusiasm</strong> she has for her job</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have you figured it out? Try another pair of examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I look for <strong>confidence</strong> in my employees.</em></li>\n<li><em>I was surprised that he had <strong>the confidence</strong> to sing in public.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's the rule:</p>\n<p>When we use <strong>an abstract uncountable noun</strong> to refer to <strong>a specific example</strong> of a noun, we use <strong>the</strong> before the noun. After the noun there will often be a defining relative clause.</p>\n<p>When we use <strong>an abstract uncountable noun</strong> to make<strong> a general statement</strong>, we don’t use <strong>the</strong>.</p>\n<p>Look at the examples again and you will see that when <strong>the</strong> is used there is a reference to a particular and specific example of that noun.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>If you think you've got it, try the quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So how did you get on with the quiz?

What’s so appealing about the smartphone self-portrait? Come with us to take a look at <strong>the big picture </strong>and answer some questions to test your understanding.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Here's an article about selfies. Read it quite quickly the first time and try to answer this question: Why is the White House concerned about President Barack Obama's selfies? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Part 1 <br/></strong>Since the 2014 Oscars ceremony selfie showing <strong>the likes of</strong> Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence <strong>took the internet by storm</strong>, it seems people <strong>can't get enough of</strong> the arm-stretching self-portrait. It's been shared more than 3 million times on social media. And now it seems impossible to stop people sharing even their most <strong>intimate</strong> moments. The reality TV star Kim Kardashian could be called 'the queen of the selfie'. She's turned hundreds of them into a book in which you can see her - amongst other things - in her <strong>undies</strong>, pregnant, not pregnant and sticking her tongue out.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 <br/></strong>If Kim Kardashian is the queen of the selfie, then you could say Barack Obama is the king. But though Kardashian has nothing to lose by sharing too much, the same can't be said of the US president. Politicians have to be careful with selfies. The photo he took at the funeral of South African leader Nelson Mandela divided public opinion. Some felt it made him look like one of us – glad to record a moment with his '<strong>mates</strong>' British Prime Minister David Cameron and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt. Others felt the head of state behaved like a teenager at a pop concert. And his wife, Michelle, was not <strong>amused</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3 <br/></strong>The White House has been keeping an eye on the selfie president ever since he was photographed with a baseball player who had a deal to promote a Korean smartphone. Barack Obama can't be seen to be advertising a product.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the US congressman Anthony Weiner, there was no such advice available. His habit of photographing his <strong>private parts</strong>, which he sent as selfies to women, meant he was soon <strong>out of the picture. </strong>The scandal killed Weiner's political career.</p>\n<p>An obsession with selfies can harm your health as well as your career. Todd Fassler from California ended up in hospital after he found a rattlesnake. And guess what? Yes, you <strong>get the picture</strong> - he tried to take a selfie with it. The animal wasn't keen on the idea - and bit him.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4 <br/></strong>Why do we take so many selfies? Dr Terri Apter, a psychology lecturer at Cambridge University, told the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph: \"It’s a kind of self-definition. We all like the idea of being sort of in control of our image and getting attention, being noticed, being part of the culture. There's a sense that if we're not seen, then we're invisible. You can get that <strong>exacerbated</strong> by celebrity culture that says unless you're being noticed, you're no one,\" says Dr Apter. \"You have to show your life is amazing, even if it isn't.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5 <br/></strong>The word 'selfie' was Oxford Dictionaries' 'word of the year' in 2013. But many believe the photographic self-portrait started much earlier. The first one was taken in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an amateur chemist from Philadelphia. Cameras were basic and he had to uncover the lens, run into the shot for a minute before running back to cover the lens again. These days, you don't need to run for a photo any more and soon, you won't even have to stretch your arms. In the near future you might be able to take a selfie by <strong>drone</strong>! Attach your camera to it, and it will follow your every move. Does it sound exciting to you? Are you ready for your closeup? Smile!</p>\n<p><strong>The answer to our question:</strong></p>\n<p>Question: Why is the White House concerned about President Obama's selfies?</p>\n<p>Answer: Because Obama was photographed with a baseball player who had a deal to promote a Korean smartphone. It's not good for the US president's image to appear to be advertising a particular commercial product.</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Try this quiz to check how much of the text you can understand and to do a bit more practice with articles.

This time we're looking at how to respond naturally to statements and remarks – and we're going to hear lots of really helpful verbs called <strong>link verbs</strong>. So more on that later. But first I've got Catherine here with me.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span> <br/>Hello.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <br/><span> Hi Catherine. And Catherine is going to respond to various things I say in the programme, if that's ok?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>That sounds fine.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Great. Aha – and there we have it – our very first example. What did you say Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine </strong>I think I said: \"That sounds fine.\"</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. And the verb <strong>sound</strong> there is a link verb – also known as a copular verb. Now what's interesting is that it can be followed by an adjective – great – it <strong>sounds</strong> great. And link verbs can be followed by adjectives like this. Some common ones are <strong>become</strong>, <strong>appear </strong>and <strong>remain</strong> – and we're going to look at two groups of link verbs which are often used in reactions – those to do with perception: that's <strong>seem</strong> and <strong>appear</strong>. And those to do with senses: <strong>look</strong>, <strong>feel</strong>,<strong> taste</strong>, <strong>smell </strong>and<strong> sound</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>And to show you how they're used, I'm going to have a conversation with Catherine about my plans for a <strong>shed</strong>. Now, a shed is a little building, in a garden, it's a little building used for storing things.</span></p>\n<p><span>While you listen try to count how many link verbs can you hear. Now just to remind you the link verbs we're looking at are: <strong>look</strong>, <strong>feel</strong>,<strong> taste</strong>,<strong> smell </strong>and<strong> sound </strong>– to do with<strong> senses</strong>, and<strong> seem </strong>and<strong> appear </strong>– to do with perception. </span></p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>So Catherine – you know, I'm thinking of buying a shed.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>A shed, Finn? A <strong>man cave</strong>, in other words. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span> <br/>A man cave, yes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span> <br/>That <strong>sounds alright</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>You really interested?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>I am actually, I have a shed myself.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>OK, great. Well I think this shed's going to be really cool. Here, have a look at it from the outside. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Ooh Finn, it <strong>looks fantastic</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>It <strong>looks good</strong>, yeah? It's quite big.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>It's big, bigger than I was expecting. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>But wait until you see the inside!</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>There's more?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>When you open the doors, you see… that. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>That's actually the inside of your shed? That <strong>looks amazing</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>My shed-to-be, it's got a bar in it, and it has <strong>all manner of</strong> drinks. All my friends can come.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Actually, the bar area <strong>seems a little small</strong>, I must say.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Yes, ok, well have a look at this picture, when you go all the way inside it's made of wood, it's made of pine. So, do you like that smell?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine <br/>Smells lovely</strong>, Finn. <strong>It smells fantastic</strong>. I love the smell of pine on a hot day, when it's been raining.</span></p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So – there were quite a few there, weren't there! And my shed <strong>sounds</strong> impressive, doesn't it? It sounds impressive. In the conversation we heard <strong>sounds </strong>once, <strong>looks</strong> I think three times, <strong>seems</strong> once and even <strong>smells</strong> twice! And as you can see, we use these verbs a lot. So is there anything we need to know? Well, let me I'll repeat the key phrases. First, we heard these:</span></p>\n<p><span>That <strong>sounds alright</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>It <strong>looks fantastic</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>It <strong>looks good</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>That <strong>sounds amazing</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Now, In each of these, we have a subject, a verb and an adjective. And each of the adjectives described feelings and opinions – alright, fantastic, good and amazing… They're really used a lot in spoken English, both for expressing opinions like this, and also agreeing to do things.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example – if I told you about a new film with your favourite actor, you might say: \"That sounds fantastic!\" Or if I showed you my new haircut you could say \"You look great!\"  Notice that we do usually use the verb <strong>sounds</strong> for things we talk about, and <strong>looks </strong>for things we see, or look at. Now of course, when it's appropriate, we could say feels – my coat feels warm, or as Catherine said about the wood in my shed:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Smells lovely</strong>, Finn. It smells fantastic.</span></p>\n<p><span>Did you notice something there that we also do in English? We often leave out the subject. So, you'll often hear something like <strong>looks great</strong> or <strong>sounds fantastic</strong> without a subject.</span></p>\n<p><span>And I did say we could use these for agreeing to do things as well. So for example, if I said: \"Do you want to go for a drink on Friday?\", you might say: \"Sounds good.\" In other words, \"yes, let's do it.\"</span></p>\n<p><span>OK. Now, finally – we had Catherine saying: \"The bar seems a little small.\" Catherine could have just said <strong>it seems small</strong>, that would have been fine. But to make it sound less direct she used the quantifier <strong>a little</strong>. She could also have said something like <strong>very</strong>, or <strong>really</strong> – <strong>it seems really small</strong>! And of course, she could also have used another link verb like <strong>looks</strong> – <strong>it looks a little small</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>So there we are – me, my shed, and some ways to react using link verbs. Do listen out for them in English. I'm going to say goodbye, and leave you with that conversation one more time. Bye.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>So Catherine – you know, I'm thinking of buying a shed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>A shed, Finn? A <strong>man cave</strong>, in other words.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>A man cave, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>That <strong>sounds alright</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>You really interested?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>I am actually, I have a shed myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>OK, great. Well I think this shed's going to be really cool. Here, have a look at it from the outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Ooh Finn, it <strong>looks fantastic</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>It <strong>looks good</strong>, yeah? It's quite big.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>It's big, bigger than I was expecting.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>But wait until you see the inside!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>There's more?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>When you open the doors, you see… that.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>That's actually the inside of your shed?

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Sounds great!</h3>\n<p>In this How do you… guide we're looking at <strong>link verbs</strong> and how to use them to sound more natural in conversation.</p>\n<p>What are link verbs? Also known as linking verbs or copular verbs, they're verbs that can be followed by adjectives - to give more information about the subject of the verb. Verbs like <strong>look</strong>, <strong>sound</strong> and <strong>seem</strong> are all examples, and they're often used in conversation like this:</p>\n<p><em>I'm buying a new shed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Wow, that sounds great!</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to Finn and Catherine in the programme. What are the different link verbs related to senses?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Did you hear how many link verbs relate to senses? Five: <strong>look, feel, taste, smell and sound</strong>.</p>\n<p>We also heard two link verbs relating to perception – or how we experience things: <strong>seem</strong> and <strong>appear.</strong> We use these when we have a bit more information about something.</p>\n<h3>Take note</h3>\n<p>1) These verbs can be used with a subject, or more informally, without a subject:</p>\n<p><em>It <strong>smells</strong> lovely, Finn.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Smells</strong> lovely, Finn.</em></p>\n<p>2) We can use them both to respond to what people say, and to agree to do things, like this:</p>\n<p><em>Want to see some jazz on Friday?</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Sounds</strong> good.</em></p>\n<p>3) They can also function as normal verbs:</p>\n<p><em>She <strong>looked</strong> angry</em> (followed by adjective) = she had an angry expression<br/><em>She <strong>looked</strong> angrily at him</em> (followed by adverb) = she looked in an angry way</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Try to respond to what people say this conversation using your knowledge of link verbs.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>    <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn…</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And I’m Catherine. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In today’s programme, we’re talking about antonyms.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Antonyms are words with opposite meanings.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Like big and small…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Fat and thin… We’re going to give you lots of examples of antonyms today. And we’ll give you a top tip for improving your vocabulary.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>    <br/>So let’s start by listening to someone called Ruth. She's shopping and trying on shoes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>While you listen, think about this question: what colour are the two pairs of shoes with heels?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Assistant<br/></strong></span><span>Here’s a selection.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>I’ll try these on first… Hmm – they’re a bit <strong>uncomfortable</strong> – too <strong>tight</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Assistant<br/></strong></span><span>OK. Try these. They’re the next size up.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>Hmm… they’re a little more <strong>comfortable</strong>, but they’re too <strong>wide</strong> at the back and they feel a bit <strong>loose</strong>! I’ve got very <strong>narrow</strong> feet.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Assistant<br/></strong></span><span>What about the flat ones?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>They look a bit <strong>old-fashioned</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Assistant<br/></strong></span><span>These <strong>dark</strong> blue ones with the heels are really popular at the moment.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>Yes, they’re quite <strong>trendy</strong>, but I think I prefer the <strong>light blue</strong> ones… Actually, the dark blue ones are quite nice… Oh, I’m so <strong>indecisive</strong>!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>So that was Ruth shopping there. And we asked you: what colours were the two pairs of shoes with heels?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: one pair was <strong>dark</strong> blue and one pair was <strong>light</strong> blue.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Dark</strong> and <strong>light</strong> are antonyms. Here they’re describing two different shades of blue. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now we often find antonyms when we are comparing things. So listen to this clip for some more opposites.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Ruth</span></strong><br/><span>Hmm – they’re a bit <strong>uncomfortable</strong> – too <strong>tight</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Assistant</span></strong><br/><span>OK. Try these – they’re the next size up.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>They’re a little more <strong>comfortable</strong>, but they’re too <strong>wide</strong> at the back and feel a bit <strong>loose</strong>! I’ve got very <strong>narrow</strong> feet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>tight, </strong>spelt<strong> t-i-g-h-t, </strong>meaning fitting too closely.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And we had the opposite <strong>loose</strong>, spelt <strong>l-o-o-s-e</strong>, meaning not fitting closely.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Ruth also said that one pair of shoes were too <strong>wide </strong>because she’s got <strong>narrow</strong> feet. So <strong>wide</strong>, spelt <strong>w-i-d-e</strong>, means the space from one side to the other is bigger than usual or bigger than comfortable. <strong>Narrow</strong>, spelt <strong>n-a-r-r-o-w</strong>, means the opposite – the space from one side to the other is smaller than usual or smaller than comfortable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There were two other words that are opposites – <strong>comfortable</strong> and <strong>uncomfortable</strong>. The difference between these two words is just two letters <strong>u</strong> and <strong>n</strong>, which form the prefix <strong>un</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And in English we often use the prefixes <strong>un, in</strong> (spelt <strong>i-n</strong>) and <strong>dis </strong>(spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>) to make antonyms. If we put one of these prefixes at the start of the word, it can change the meaning of the word to its opposite.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So Ruth said that she was <strong>indecisive</strong>. By adding the prefix <strong>in</strong> (<strong>i-n</strong>) to the word <strong>decisive</strong>, which means being able to make decisions easily, we make <strong>indecisive</strong>, which has the opposite meaning – not being able to make decisions easily. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>What are you Finn?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I’m a little indecisive, I must say.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Are you sure about that? Not really?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Very good.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have another short clip with two more antonyms. Can you spot them?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Assistant<br/></strong></span><span>What about the flat ones?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>They look a bit <strong>old-fashioned</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Assistant<br/></strong></span><span>These dark blue ones with the heels are really popular at the moment.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Ruth<br/></strong></span><span>Yes, they’re quite <strong>trendy</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>old-fashioned</strong> and <strong>trendy</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>You describe something as <strong>old-fashioned</strong> when it looks like it’s from a time in the past. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Whereas something that is <strong>trendy</strong> is modern, up-to-date or cool.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And we’re talking about antonyms, which are words with opposite meanings.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>The prefixes <strong>un</strong>, <strong>in</strong> and <strong>dis</strong> are often used to make antonyms, for example: <strong>decisive</strong> and<strong> indecisive</strong>. Now all the words we’ve seen earlier are adjectives, but other parts of speech can be antonyms.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So you can have verbs, like <strong>ask</strong> and <strong>answer</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Which is what we’re going to do now because it’s time for a quiz. So, what is the opposite of the word tight: is it a) loose or b) narrow?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>     <br/>The answer is a) <strong>loose</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>    <br/>Well done if you got that right. Number two: trendy. Is the opposite a) modern or b) old-fashioned?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>     <br/>It’s b) <strong>old-fashioned</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That’s correct! And number three: comfortable. Is the opposite a) discomfortable or b) uncomfortable? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is b)<strong> uncomfortable</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And that’s the end of the quiz – so well done if you got them all right.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And now here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: when you learn a new word, have a look in the dictionary to see if there is a prefix that will help you make the opposite word. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Yes, and that way you can get two words for the price of one!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Bargain!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Absolutely.

If you're talking about a surface, the opposite is <strong>soft</strong>. If you're talking about an exam, the opposite is… <strong>easy</strong>. So, each word can have more than one antonym.</span></span></p>\n<p><span></span>Does that make sense? OK, let's put this knowledge to the test!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong><span><span>To do</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>Imagine you live in the beautiful, ancient European city of San Ronaldo. It's time for the city to choose a new mayor, and the two candidates have very different visions for the city. One thinks it should keep its old-fashioned <strong>charm</strong> and focus on tourism; the other believes the only way to succeed is to <strong>modernise</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So, we begin with a speech from candidate number one. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>After that, you have to complete the speech by candidate number two, who disagrees with everything the first one said. In other words, it's a great opportunity to practise antonyms!</span></span></p>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Candidate one's speech</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span></span>\"I love San Ronaldo. It's a beautiful city. And that's its biggest advantage. Our narrow streets are perfect for cafes and galleries. We appeal to older tourists with more money. It's hard to see why we should change. We need to remain a traditional town - this is our biggest strength.\"</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Was that easy or hard? Simple or complicated?

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And me, Finn. Hello.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And today we're talking about six different ways of talking about the future – like <strong>will </strong>and <strong>be going to</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>We can also use the <strong>present simple</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> tenses, and we're going to share a couple of other ways as well…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>That’s right and as usual, there'll be a quiz at the end to test what you've learned. So let's get started. First, we’ll look at <strong>will</strong> and <strong>be going to</strong>. They're both very common, and a lot of the time they're used in a similar way, to talk about predictions. But not always. So – let's hear an example of <strong>be going to</strong> – Finn, a question for you: what's for dinner tonight?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hmmm… <strong>I'm</strong> <strong>going to cook</strong> my favourite meal. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I know what that is...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That’s curry! I've got all the ingredients already. And you, Catherine? What about you?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Well, I haven't made any plans – <strong>I'll</strong> probably just have something simple… like tomato soup.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Ooh, sounds yummy.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Yeah. So - Finn <strong>is</strong> <strong>going to</strong> cook curry. He already knew his plan at the time of speaking. It’s his intention – or his plan – to cook curry. And we often use <strong>be going to</strong> in this way.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And Catherine – what did you say about tomato soup, again?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I said… <strong>I'll </strong>probably have something simple… like tomato soup.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, so Catherine used <strong>I’ll</strong> or <strong>will -</strong> <strong>I will </strong>– but she made her decision at the time of speaking – so this is one of the main differences between <strong>will</strong> and <strong>going to</strong>. Ok, so we have four more ways of talking about the future to look at….</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>We do and we have to talk some more about your curry, Finn, at this point. So <strong>are you eating </strong>alone?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>No, <strong>I'm eating </strong>with a couple of friends.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Aha! Now this time my question and Finn's answer are both in the <strong>present continuous</strong> – but we’re using the present continuous to talk about the future. We use the present continuous for arrangements like this – so Finn has arranged to eat with friends.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>Yes.<strong> I'm eating</strong> with friends. And you know, we could also use <strong>be going to</strong> for this as well, but not <strong>will.</strong> So I could say: <strong>I'm going to</strong> <strong>eat</strong> with a couple of friends.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So that’s three ways, and now there’s another present tense we can use to talk about the future and that’s the <strong>present simple</strong>. So curry time again, Finn. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s talk about curry!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>When are your friends coming to dinner?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Well, my friends are passing through London on a very tight schedule. So <strong>they arrive</strong> at the station at 5pm, <strong>we eat</strong> dinner at 6pm, and <strong>they leave</strong> on a plane at 9pm the same night!</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>How exciting! And that conveniently demonstrates why we use the present simple for future events – we use it to talk about timetables. <strong>Your friends arrive</strong> at the station at 5pm, </span><span><strong>we eat</strong> dinner at 6pm, and <strong>they leave </strong>on a plane at 9pm the same night. And these are all things that are planned to happen at specific times.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>Right. Now Catherine, it's your turn to use our next form – <strong>be about to</strong> – to talk about your dinner plans, OK?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. <strong>I'm</strong> <strong>about to</strong> say something about tomato soup.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>OK, you’re about to. OK, very good, very clever.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. So we use <strong>be about to</strong>, for things in the very near future. And <strong>be about to</strong> is followed by the base form of a verb. So the film <strong>is about to start.</strong> Or the train <strong>is about to leave,</strong> things like that.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>Great! So we’ve now looked at five ways of talking about the future. What about the sixth?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Well, the sixth way isn't actually a tense, it’s not even a phrase – it's just a group of normal everyday verbs. And now it’s time to bring in Callum who’s been waiting patiently. Listen carefully for the verbs that Callum uses to talk about the future. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Callum<br/></span></strong><span>I <strong>plan</strong> <strong>to do</strong> evening classes in coding.</span></p>\n<p><span>I <strong>aim</strong> <strong>to finish</strong> all the preparation by 8pm.</span></p>\n<p><span>Wang Chun <strong>intends to move</strong> to Berlin.</span></p>\n<p><span>We've <strong>arranged</strong> <strong>to meet</strong> in person next spring.</span></p>\n<p><span>She <strong>decided</strong> <strong>to take</strong> the money.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Good. So we heard <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>aim</strong>, <strong>intend</strong>, <strong>arrange</strong> and <strong>decide</strong>. In fact, lots of verbs can be used like this – followed by <strong>to</strong> and <strong>the base form of a verb</strong> – to talk about the future. So listen out for them! Oh, and thank you Callum.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Callum</span></strong><br/><span>You're welcome.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And now, it's quiz time! Question one. If you've already made a plan to visit France, which is better? a) I will travel to France this year or b) I'm going to travel to France this year?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>The answer is b) I'm going to travel to France this year. Number two. Which is correct? a) We're about to get married next summer or b) We plan to get married next summer.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And the correct answer is b) We plan to get married next summer. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got all those right.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well done indeed and it’s also the end of the show. There's more about this on our website at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The future is now</h3>\n<p><span>How many ways of talking about the future do you know? </span></p>\n<p><span>In this session we're <strong>going to</strong> look at six different ways. You may know some or all of them already, but it's good to do some revision every now and again. Later in the course <strong>we'll</strong> look at even more ways of talking about the future!</span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>One morning with Horatio</h3>\n<p>Let's start with a story. A story about a businessman... an incredibly busy businessman! Let's call him Horatio. Have a look at the six ways of talking about the future he uses (they're in <strong>bold</strong>).</p>\n<p><em>\"Hi, I'm Horatio. It's 6am and I've just got to the office. Let me tell you about the day ahead. <strong>I'm going to</strong> call our partner in Bangkok at 7am. Then <strong>I'm meeting</strong> three new clients for coffee. After that <strong>I plan to write</strong> our annual report. Today <strong>I finish</strong> work at 12 and after that <strong>I'll</strong> just spend the whole afternoon meditating. Peace and love, brothers. Yes, I'm pretty incredible... I've got to go in a minute, <strong>I'm about to</strong> do a video conference with Delhi... Oh, that's my phone, sorry. I wonder who that is? <strong>I'll</strong> just answer that.\"</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Did you notice the different ways? We're going to look at them in more detail in a moment. But first, let's do a test to see how well you understand how to use them already, using examples from Horatio's story.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>1) <strong>Will</strong> is used for statements and <strong>predictions</strong> about the future. It often expresses the future as fact – so it's used for very strong opinions or predictions. It can also be used for <strong>instant decisions</strong> made at the time of speaking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>In 100 years' time, everyone <strong>will</strong> have an electric car.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sorry, I'm in a hurry. <strong>I'll</strong> take the car and you walk.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) <strong>Be going to</strong> is used for present situations that extend into the future, or for something you want to do. There is often present evidence for the prediction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The government <strong>is going to</strong> <strong>raise </strong>fuel taxes.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>3) The <strong>present continuous</strong> is used for arrangements. It's very similar to going to for intention.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>I'm cooking</em></strong><em> for six guests next week.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>4) The <strong>present simple</strong> is used for timetabled events.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The meal <strong>starts</strong> at six.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>5) In addition, we can use <strong>be about to</strong> talk about that will happen in the near future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Quick, the film is <strong>about to</strong> start!</em></li>\n<li><em>We're <strong>about to</strong> leave. Get on the bus.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>6) Some normal verbs also indicate plans and intentions for the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I <strong>plan</strong> to study photography next year.</em></li>\n<li><em>I <strong>aim</strong> to be finished by 8pm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Mark <strong>intends</strong> to move to Berlin.</em></li>\n<li><em>We've <strong>arranged</strong> to meet next Monday.</em></li>\n<li><em>She <strong>decided</strong> to take the train tomorrow.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Form factor</h3>\n<p><strong>Will: </strong>subject + will + base form of verb</p>\n<p><strong>Be going to: </strong>subject + am/are/is going to + base form of verb</p>\n<p><strong>Present continuous: </strong>subject + am/are/is + verb-ing</p>\n<p><strong>Present simple: </strong>subject + verb</p>\n<p><strong>About to: </strong>subject + am/are/is about to + base form of verb</p>\n<p><strong>Normal verbs: </strong>use as usual, followed by to + base form of verb</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, do you feel you can use all that language correctly? Try it out in our next activity, as we meet a girl called Helga who plans to travel the world.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Round the world trip</h3>\n<p>It's now time to try out all those ways of talking about the future.</p>\n<p>This time let's imagine a girl called Helga. She's just graduated from high school and plans to go to university, but first she wants to travel round the world. Here are a few notes from her diary:</p>\n<p><em>Places to visit: Japan, Australia, Chile... maybe more</em></p>\n<p><em>Where to stay: Three weeks with the Matsumoto family in Tokyo to begin with, hotels and guesthouses in the other places</em></p>\n<p><em>Itinerary: Booked the 6am flight to Tokyo tomorrow! Volunteering in a orphanage in Thailand... and booked a one-month Spanish language course in Santiago</em></p>\n<p><em>Don't forget: Uncle Jason is coming this afternoon to lend me his Japanese phrasebook</em></p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Can you use the words provided to make sentences about Helga's story? This will test your knowledge of form, meaning and use of our six ways of talking about the future.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>In 6 Minute Grammar we'll hear Finn and Catherine give a summary of all these ways of talking about the future. We'll also find out about Finn's dinner plans... he likes curry!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Talking about the future</h3>\n<p>In English, we can use <strong>will</strong>, <strong>be going to</strong>, the <strong>present simple</strong> or <strong>present continuous</strong> tenses, phrases like <strong>about to,</strong> and verbs like <strong>aim</strong> and <strong>plan - </strong>all to talk about the future.</p>\n<p>Join Catherine and Finn as they explain the various ways of discussing the future. And hear about Finn's plans to cook a delicious curry for his dinner. Then try the quiz to see how much you've learnt.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Download</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Grammar from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-17/downloads\" target=\"_self\">Unit 17 downloads page</a>.

Do you want to talk about the future? Well, now you are spoilt for choice when using different ways of doing it. Our next session is all about the future of the world's most endangered species.</p></div>",

That's</span></span><span><span> according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Some of them have had their numbers <strong>drastically</strong> reduced because of <strong>poaching</strong> and the destruction of their <strong>natural habitat</strong> by humans or as a result of climate change. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Here's some information about 5 of the species listed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as <strong>critically endangered</strong> because they are facing an extremely high risk of extinction <strong>in the wild</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read this article carefully. There is a picture quiz at the end to test what you've understood.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>5 of the world's most endangered animals</h3>\n<p><strong>Black rhino </strong>(<em>Diceros bicornis) <br/></em>Rhinos are one of the oldest groups of <strong>mammals</strong>. Some say they are virtually living <strong>fossils</strong>. But they will end up as fossils if poaching is not stopped. <em> </em>Poaching on a large scale between 1970 and 1992 <strong>wiped out</strong> ninety-six percent of black rhinos. They live in Namibia and east coast of Africa and are targeted particularly for their <strong>horns</strong>. It’s believed that there are fewer than 5,000 surviving.</p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Hawksbill turtle </strong>(</span></span><span><span><em>Eretmochelys imbricate) <br/></em>These <strong>reptiles</strong> have lived for more than a hundred million years, but some species are not going to be with us for much longer if the rate of decline is not stopped. Hawksbill turtles live in tropical oceans and play an important role in maintaining <strong>coral reefs</strong>.  They feed on sponges and create better access for fish to find their own food on the reef’s surface. But the species is under threat, not only from the pollution which is damaging their habitat, but also from fishing practises and the illegal trade in their shells. They go to the surface to breathe, and if caught up in nets and hooks, they drown. Conservationists aim to work with fishermen to prevent turtles being caught in nets.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Sumatran tiger </strong>(</span></span><span><span><em>Panthera tigris sumatrae) <br/></em>Fewer than four hundred Sumatran tigers survive in the remaining areas of forests of their native island. Rapid <strong>deforestation</strong> and poaching mean this species could end up extinct like its Javan and Balinese relatives. Indonesian law protects them by imposing jail sentences and fines for poachers. But there’s still a big market in Asia for tiger products.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Western lowland gorilla</strong> (</span></span><span><span><em>Gorilla gorilla gorilla) <br/></em>These gorillas can be found in the Congo Basin and Central Africa. Poaching and the deadly virus Ebola, also found in the region, have caused a decline by more than sixty percent in the number of western lowland gorillas over the last twenty to twenty-five years. It’s worth noting that the handling of bushmeat by hunters might have helped the spread of Ebola to humans. Scientists believe that even if the threat to the species is removed it will take about seventy-five years for its population to recover. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Amur leopard </strong>(</span></span><span><span><em>Panthera pardus orientalis) <br/></em>The Amur leopard can be found in the far east of Russia<em>. </em>Its beautiful fur attracts poachers. But conservationists see the <strong>light at the end of the tunnel</strong> for this animal as their population has more than doubled in just seven years. Recent reports put the number of these big cats at fifty-seven in Russia’s Land of the Leopard National Park. There are also 8 to 12 individuals in neighbouring Chinese areas. </span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Try this quiz to check how much of the text you can understand.</span></span></p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>We hope you learnt a lot from this session.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Dr Tim Cockerill</strong><br/>A <strong>zoologist</strong> is a person who studies animals – so the science behind animals – so that could be anything from studying the <strong>diversity</strong> – all the different kinds of animals that exist, or it could be the way that animals interact with other living things like plants or even the way that animals and humans get on together. Many of the animal <strong>species</strong> on our planet are in decline – so they are threatened species and what we do as zoologists is try to work out ways to save those animals in the future, so what will our world look like in fifty or a hundred years' time? Well, we hope we can save lots of those animals that are still around at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Without the important work that people like you do, what could happen to our planet?<br/><br/><strong>Dr Tim Cockerill</strong><br/>Well humans are already having a really big effect on our planet so if we're not careful at reducing those <strong>impacts</strong>, well what we're going to see in the future is a world that's very different to the world that we're in today where there are fewer animals around and fewer living things and of course that's going to have a very big impact on the way that we live.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And are we seeing evidence of that at the moment?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Tim Cockerill</strong><br/>We certainly are seeing <strong>evidence</strong> of that at the moment so there are already larger species of animals that are going extinct and of course in the future we're going to see other large animals going extinct but lots of smaller animals disappearing as well and some people think there are animals that have disappeared and that will disappear in the future that we haven't even discovered yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We hear a lot of negative, a lot of scare stories about endangered animals and we're going to lose animals and insects and plants and all kinds of things. How true do you think that is? How serious is the problem?<br/><br/><strong>Dr Tim Cockerill<br/></strong>Some people say we are in the 6th major extinction event so that means that we're in a time when lots and lots of our animal species are dying out so this is the first time that we know about where humans are having a direct impact on our planet and it definitely is happening but what we don't know is to what extent it's happening – so we don't know how many of those animals that are surviving now will still be alive in fifty or a hundred years' time. What I really hope is that in the future we can work out a way to reduce our impact not only on the climate of our planet but on all the living things like the plants and of course the animals that live there.</p> </div>",

I’m Peter.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I’m Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. And today we’re talking about acronyms. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>Examples of acronyms are the name <strong>FIFA</strong>, that’s the international federation of association football, and <strong>BBC</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We’ll talk about where these names come from and we'll tell you how we say and write them.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>There will be a quiz of course; and we’ll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s start by listening to James. He’s giving a lecture about the United Nations.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter</span><br/></strong><span>And while you’re listening: Can you guess where the name <strong>UNESCO</strong> comes from?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>James<br/></strong>The United Nations aims to encourage international cooperation and preserve world peace. A number of different organisations are part of it. One of the most well-known is <strong>UNESCO</strong>. That’s the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. But you may also have heard of the <strong>W-H-O</strong>, the <strong>I-M-F</strong>, and the<strong> W-B-G</strong>, for example. Do you know what they are? The <strong>UN</strong> performs most of its work through these different organisations.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter</span><br/></strong><span>So we asked you: Can you guess where the name <strong>UNESCO</strong> comes from?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is that it comes from the first letters of the organisation’s full name: <strong>U</strong>nited <strong>N</strong>ations <strong>E</strong>ducational, <strong>S</strong>cientific and <strong>C</strong>ultural <strong>O</strong>rganisation: <strong>UNESCO</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>Now with acronyms like <strong>UNESCO</strong>, we say them as if they are a word: <strong>UNESCO</strong>. We don’t spell out the letters separately. We don't say<strong> U-N-E-S-C-O</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Other acronyms like this that are very well-known are <strong>NATO</strong>, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and <strong>NASA</strong>, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>That’s easy for you to say. By the way,<strong> FIFA</strong> is a bit of a trick. The acronym actually comes from the French name for the organisation, not the English. Federation Internationale de Football Association.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Nice accent.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>Merci.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So what about the other acronyms James mentioned? Let’s listen.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/>James       <br/></strong>… you may also have heard of the <strong>W-H-O</strong>, the <strong>I-M-F</strong>, and the<strong> W-B-G</strong>, for example.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now these next acronyms are a bit different. We spell out the initial letters separately. Can you guess what these letters stand for? <strong>W-H-O</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Peter<br/></strong></span><span>That’s the World Health Organisation.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It is. Now:<strong> I-M-F</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>It’s the International Monetary Fund.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>W-B-G</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>The World Bank Group.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it’s worth remembering that we usually write both types of acronym with capital letters. Now for another clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/>James<br/></strong></span><span>The <strong>UN</strong> performs most of its work through these different organisations.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now it’s interesting that James started off by saying the United Nations. But here he says the <strong>UN</strong>. Why’s that do you think?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>Well, using acronyms saves time and it makes the organisations seem more familiar. With the second type of acronym like <strong>U-N</strong>, where you spell out the letters, we sometimes use the full name the first time we mention the organisation and then, once we’ve done that, we go on to use the acronym as we continue to talk about it.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK. But with the first type of acronym like <strong>UNESCO</strong>, where you say it as a word, we nearly always use just the acronym. That’s probably because the full names are often so long that the acronyms have actually become like words to replace them.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, in fact there are a few words in English that used to be acronyms but have now become ordinary words. These words are not written with capital letters. For example <strong>scuba</strong> as in <strong>scuba diving.</strong> This comes from <strong>s</strong>elf-<strong>c</strong>ontained <strong>u</strong>nderwater <strong>b</strong>reathing <strong>a</strong>pparatus. And <strong>laser</strong> comes from <strong>l</strong>ight <strong>a</strong>mplification by <strong>s</strong>timulated <strong>e</strong>mission of <strong>r</strong>adiation.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Wow, well yes, that is quite a mouthful, isn’t it?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>It certainly does go on…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter</span><br/></strong><span>We’re talking about acronyms. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it’s quiz time! And this time it’s a bit of a general knowledge game because we’re going to see if you know what some popular acronyms stand for. And not all of them are organisations. So number one: <strong>WWW</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>It’s the World Wide Web.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It is, indeed. Now number two: <strong>RAM</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter</span></strong><br/><span>That’s Random Access Memory. We use it for a type of computer memory.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We do. And the last one: <strong>CIA</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>It’s the Central Intelligence Agency in the US.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It is indeed - and well done if you got them all right. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>And before we go, here’s a vocabulary tip. There are a lot of acronyms in everyday life as well as those that are organisations. For example: <strong>ATM</strong>, <strong>DIY</strong> and <strong>FYI</strong>. We use them all the time. When you see an acronym written in capital letters, check out what it stands for online or find a dictionary. They do make sense and are easy to remember when you know the full name or meaning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Peter<br/></span></strong><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>.

The acronyms come from the first letters of the organisations' full names. They are usually written in capital letters.</p>\n<p><strong>UNESCO</strong> is an acronym for the <strong>U</strong>nited <strong>N</strong>ations <strong>E</strong>ducational, <strong>S</strong>cientific and <strong>C</strong>ultural <strong>O</strong>rganisation.</p>\n<p>We pronounce acronyms as words: <strong>UNESCO</strong>, <strong>NATO</strong> and <strong>NASA</strong> are all important organisations.</p>\n<p>Others are said as letters, using the initial (first) letters of each word: The <strong>UN</strong> (U-N), the <strong>EU</strong> (E-U), and the <strong>FBI</strong> (F-B-I). These are known as initialisms.</p>\n<p>Using acronyms and initialisms saves time and makes organisations seem more familiar to us. Many are also in everyday life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I need to get some money from the <strong>ATM</strong> (Automatic Teller Machine).</em></li>\n<li><em>I'm doing some <strong>DIY</strong> this weekend (Do It Yourself = building and repairing things at home without employing professionals).</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>FYI</strong>, I'm not free this Friday (For Your Information).</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So when you see a group of letters like UNICEF - do you read them as a word or as individual letters? Test yourself in our quiz, next!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The shorter the better</h3>\n<p>In 6 Minute English we learned some acronyms for organisations, and a few acronyms that we use in everyday life.  Some of them, like NATO, are said as words and some, like ATM, are said as letters. Strictly speaking, we should call the second group 'intialisms' – because they are formed from the initial (first) letters of each word.</p>\n<p>So, what happens if you're reading a text in English and you see a group of capital letters – do you read them as a word or just read out the initial letters individually? This game will help you learn a few common examples.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Drag each acronym and initialism into the correct column. Some were in the programme, some are new. Tip: Try to read each one out loud – is it possible to read it as a word? If so, it could be a true acronym.</p>\n<p>There is a list of their meanings under the quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Acronyms and their full meanings</h3>\n<p><strong>AOB</strong> <br/>Any Other Business (used in meetings and business communication)</p>\n<p><strong>DVD</strong> <br/>Digital Versatile Disc</p>\n<p><strong>FYI</strong> <br/>For Your Information (used in business communication, and sometimes spoken)</p>\n<p><strong>NATO</strong> <br/>North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</p>\n<p><strong>UFO</strong> <br/>Unidentified Flying Object</p>\n<p><strong>UNESCO</strong> <br/>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation</p>\n<p><strong>UNICEF</strong> <br/>United Nations Children's Fund</p>\n<p><strong>WHO</strong> <br/>World Health Organisation</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done.

Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine        <br/></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>          <br/>In this programme, we’re talking about relative clauses.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine  <br/></strong>Yes, relative clauses add information about the person or thing that you’re talking about. There are two kinds of relative clauses: defining and non-defining.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>          <br/>Let’s begin with defining relative clauses. Here’s Finn with an example:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn         <br/></strong>The man <strong>whose phone I found</strong> gave me a reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>          <br/>Thanks Finn. The clause <strong>whose phone I found</strong> is a defining relative clause because it identifies which man Finn is talking about. If I ask the question ‘which man’ – the relative clause answers it: the man <strong>whose phone I found</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>          <br/>That's right. And relative clauses usually start with a relative pronoun. We use <strong>who</strong> for people, <strong>which </strong>for things, <strong>that</strong> for both people and things and <strong>whose </strong>where a possessive is needed. Let’s hear another defining relative clause:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn       <br/></strong>I’ve lost the t-shirt <strong>that my mother gave me</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum        <br/></strong>How careless of you Finn! Here, the relative clause <strong>that my mother gave me</strong> tells us which t-shirt Finn is talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>I’ve lost the t-shirt that my mother gave me.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Let’s move on to non-defining relative clauses. Here’s an example:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>David’s mother, <strong>who was born in Mexico</strong>, is my sister’s Spanish teacher.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine        <br/></strong>OK. The phrase <strong>who was born in Mexico</strong> is a non-defining relative clause. It doesn't answer the question ‘which mother?’ because David only has one mother! Instead, the relative clause gives us extra information about David’s mother: she was born in Mexico.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum        <br/></strong>In fact, if we leave the relative clause out entirely, the sentence still makes sense:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>          <br/>David’s mother is my sister’s Spanish teacher.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum        <br/></strong>Now let’s look again at relative pronouns. We can use them to refer to the subject or object of a clause. Finn, who is Daniel Radcliffe?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn          <br/></strong>Daniel Radcliffe is the actor <strong>who</strong> plays Harry Potter.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>           <br/>In this sentence, the relative pronoun <strong>who</strong> refers to the subject – Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And another question for you Finn. Which sport do you enjoy the most?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn         <br/></strong>Well, football is the sport <strong>that</strong> I enjoy the most, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>           <br/>This time, the pronoun <strong>that</strong> refers to the object. And you can usually leave out object pronouns, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>        <br/>Football is the sport I enjoy the most.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>You’re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>           <br/>For non-defining clauses, you can’t leave out the pronoun. Also, non-defining relative clauses can't begin with the word <strong>that</strong>. Use <strong>which</strong> instead, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>      <br/>Last year I went to Paris, <strong>which</strong> is the capital of France.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum        <br/></strong>The clause <strong>which is the capital of France</strong> – is giving us extra information. We can leave it out and still understand the sentence:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>        <br/>Last year I went to Paris.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And now it's time for a quiz. Join these sentences together using a defining or non-defining relative clause. Number one. The bus was very late. I took it this morning. The bus was very late. I took it this morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>The bus <strong>that</strong> I took this morning was very late. Or you could also say: The bus I took this morning was very late.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>          <br/>You can, very good. Number two: My car needs repairing. I only bought it last month. My car needs repairing. I only bought it last month.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum  <br/></strong>My car, <strong>which</strong> I only bought last month, needs repairing. <strong>        </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>         <br/>And that was a non-defining relative clause. Number three. David Beckham has over 20 tattoos. He used to play for Manchester United. David Beckham has over 20 tattoos. He used to play for Manchester United.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum         <br/></strong>David Beckham, <strong>who</strong> used to play for Manchester United, has over 20 tattoos.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. And we could also say: David Beckham, <strong>who</strong> has over 20 tattoos, used to play for Manchester United.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>           <br/>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done you got them all right. Now for a little tip. In written English, we put commas around non-defining relative clauses. In spoken English, we leave a small pause for each comma. Listen to this example:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>          <br/>My sister, who works in Nairobi, is a doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>The pauses tell us that this is a non-defining relative clause, which means Finn has only one sister, so he doesn’t need to define her.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>           <br/>My uncle who works in Athens is a dentist.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>       <br/>And this time, there’s no pause, which means it’s a defining relative clause. Finn is defining which uncle he is talking about, so he probably has more than one uncle.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Callum        <br/></strong>Thanks Finn. So that’s defining and non-defining relative clauses. They start with a relative pronoun and give additional information about the person or thing that you’re talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>           <br/>There’s more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What is a relative clause?</h3>\n<p>A relative clause is part of a sentence. It gives information about which person or thing we are talking about.</p>\n<p>Look at this example without a relative clause:</p>\n<p><em>The flight was cancelled. We were going to take it.</em></p>\n<p>We can make these two sentences into one by using a relative clause.</p>\n<p><em>The flight <strong>that</strong> <strong>we were going to take</strong> was cancelled.</em></p>\n<p>The relative clause tells us which flight was cancelled. </p>\n<p>This type of relative clause <strong>defines </strong>the noun it is talking about. it is called a <strong>defining relative clause.</strong> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Another kind of relative clause</h3>\n<p>Let's look at a different example. First, without a relative clause.</p>\n<p><em>Our flight was cancelled. It was one of several going to Rome that day.</em></p>\n<p>Now let's look at that with a relative clause.</p>\n<p><em>Our flight, <strong>which was one of several going to Rome that day</strong>, was cancelled.</em></p>\n<p><br>Does the meaning of the sentence change if we leave out the relative clause?</br></p>\n<p><em>Our flight was cancelled.</em></p>\n<p>No, the meaning is the same. </p>\n<p><br/>Which flight are we talking about?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Our flight</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n<p>So, does the <strong>relative clause</strong> define which flight we are talking about? </p>\n<p>No, it doesn't. </p>\n<p>What is this kind of relative clause for?</p>\n<p>It gives us more information, but that information is not essential to understanding what we are talking about. It's called a <strong>non-defining relative clause</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Spotting a non-defining relative clause</h3>\n<p>In written English there is <strong>a comma</strong> at the beginning and end of a non-defining relative clause.</p>\n<p>Our flight<strong>,</strong> which was one of several going to Rome that day<strong>,</strong> was cancelled.</p>\n<p>In spoken English there will be a slight pause before and after the non-defining relative clause.</p>\n<h3>Relative pronouns</h3>\n<p>Let's look at the first example again.</p>\n<p><em>The flight was cancelled. We were going to take <strong>it</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>In the first sentence there is the pronoun <strong>it</strong>. In the sentence with the relative clause, <strong>it</strong> has been replaced by a relative pronoun, <strong>that</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>The flight <strong>that</strong> we were going to take was cancelled.</em></p>\n<p>The position of the relative pronoun is after the noun to which it refers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Subject or object pronoun?</strong></h3>\n<p>When the relative pronoun refers to the <strong>object </strong>of the verb we can leave it out.</p>\n<p>Let's look once again at the first example:</p>\n<p><em>The flight was cancelled. We were going to take <strong>it</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>The pronoun <strong>it </strong>refers to the flight. The flight is the object of the verb <strong>take.</strong> In the sentence with the relative clause we can therefore leave out the relative pronoun.</p>\n<p><em>The flight <strong>(that)</strong> we were going to take was cancelled.</em></p>\n<p>There are different <strong>relative pronouns</strong> depending on whether we are talking about people, things, places, possessions or times.<br/><strong><br/>who / that </strong>are used for people:</p>\n<p><em>The man <strong>who came to the door</strong> was collecting for charity.<br/>The lady <strong>(that) I saw in the shop</strong> wasn't Julia Roberts after all.<br/><br/></em><strong>whose </strong>is used for possessives:<br/><br/><em>The dog <strong>whose collar we found</strong> lives across the street.<br/>The man <strong>whose wallet I found</strong> gave me a reward.<br/></em><strong><br/>that / which </strong>are used for things:<br/><br/><em>I don't like films <strong>that are really scary</strong>.</em><br/><em>I want to see something on the news <strong>which doesn't make me sad or angry</strong>.<br/></em><strong><br/>where </strong>is used for places:</p>\n<p><em>Do the you remember the place <strong>(where) we first met</strong>?<br/>I want to go to a place <strong>where I've never been.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>when </strong>is used for times</p>\n<p><em>I can remember a time <strong>(when) there was no email or internet</strong>.<br/>Do you think there'll be a day this summer <strong>(when) it doesn't rain</strong>?</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you think you can spot the difference between a defining and non-defining realitve clause?

Plastic surgery has changed the lives of many people – not only of those who wanted to look more beautiful and younger, but also of people who needed almost a new face after terrible injuries. Come with us on a painless journey to learn about the history of plastic surgery. We hope your English will look prettier by the end.</span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p><span><span>Read this article about plastic surgery quite quickly. Try to find the answer to this question:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>How were members of the public living close to a plastic surgery hospital in London in the early 20th century prepared for the shock of seeing patients with horrific face injuries? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>There is no doubt that plastic surgery is popular. Almost 10 million operations were performed in 2014, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS). Eyelid surgery topped the list of the five most popular <strong>procedures</strong>, which included <strong>breast augmentation</strong> and <strong>rhinoplasty</strong>.</br></p>\n<p>We hear a lot about cosmetic surgery these days. But what many people may not realise is that reconstructing someone's face has an ancient past. There are reports of treatments to restore a broken nose in ancient Egyptian documents. And the Romans could perform simple ear-repairing techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>Considering that safe <strong>anaesthetics</strong> and <strong>antibiotics</strong> were only discovered in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was a truly painful and risky business <strong>to go under the</strong> <strong>knife</strong> in the past. But as far back as the mid-15th century <strong>nose jobs</strong> were carried out using skin taken from the upper arm. More sophisticated <strong>skin graft</strong> techniques were later brought to the West from India.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>These techniques were carefully studied by one of the great surgeons at the time of World War One, Harold Gillies. It was a time in which plastic surgery went through a revolution. The <strong>trenches</strong> protected the soldiers’ bodies. but many who stuck their heads up were exposed to explosions of all kinds. Harold Gillies, who was born in New Zealand, was an <strong>innovator</strong>. He had a <strong>ward</strong> at the Cambridge Military Hospital in Britain, and later a whole hospital dedicated to helping <strong>disfigured</strong> soldiers - Queen Mary’s in London. One of Gillies’s most successful procedures was carried out on Lieutenant William Spreckley, who had a section of <strong>rib cartilage</strong> implanted on his forehead. Six months after that it was used to construct his nose. By Spreckley’s 60th birthday, the scars were almost invisible.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>Many wounded men at that time couldn’t stand looking at their own faces. Some fainted. There were no mirrors in the hospital. And it wasn’t unusual for them to choose a life in isolation. In parks near the Queen Mary's Hospital, some benches were painted blue to signal to patients with facial injuries that they could sit there. And it was a way of telling local residents to prepare for the shock of seeing someone with a disfigured face.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5</strong><br/>Plastic surgery has come a long way since then. It reconstructs what does need reconstructing and improves what needs improving, but it also makes people with no particular problems feel more confident. Bigger breasts? Straight nose? <strong>Facelift</strong>? You name it and competent surgeons can do it. Some people go a long way to change their looks, like the late pop star Michael Jackson. And if you want to look like Michael Jackson or a Barbie doll, have a lot of cash and determination, then it might be possible. In many cases, cosmetic surgery is not a necessity at all, just a choice. But when done properly by capable doctors to patients who have a realistic goal, it is believed that plastic surgery can heal psychological wounds almost as much as physical ones.</p>\n<h3>Answer to our question:</h3>\n<p>People who lived close to a plastic surgery hospital in London early in the 20th century knew that benches painted blue were for patients with horrific facial injuries.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the article again more closely.

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>I don't want to get personal, but do you like your nose?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>My nose?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>It's quite big isn't it?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I can't believe you Rob! How dare you say that my nose it too big. Well actually, yeah you're right! My nose is pretty big.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Would you like to change it?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I think I would yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>You'd like to pick another one?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I'd like to pick another nose!</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK, well I ask you this question because we're discussing cosmetic surgery and the cost – both financially and physically – to someone who chooses to go under the knife.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>To 'go under the knife' – meaning to have an operation. And cosmetic surgery involves a medical operation in which someone's physical appearance is changed in some way.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes, like changing the shape of your nose.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Now of course, some people have plastic surgery for health reasons – they may have needed to get a tumour removed, or may need some part of their body changed in order to make it work better after an accident or something.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes but cosmetic surgery – some would argue – is about changing someone's appearance unnecessarily and it doesn't really change the person they are underneath their skin. So it's just about vanity – or being interested in your own appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Or you could say it's just about aesthetics – looking good. But other may argue, improving how they look makes them feel better about themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>But for those tempted to improve their looks surgically, how safe are the procedures? There are risks involved and in the UK in 2011 a report by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death found that staff in some clinics were too inexperienced to be offering some cosmetic procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Of course good surgeons – those are people who perform the operations - should talk through all the risks with any patient but The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, say problems have arisen because of the attitude towards cosmetic surgery – it has become trivialised. That means it's seen as less serious than it really is.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes, there are serious risks involved in having an operation and there can be long-term effects from having surgery. This is something Doctor Felicity Mehendale is concerned about. She is a consultant cleft and plastic surgeon. She thinks there are other alternatives to cosmetic surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well let's hear from her now and listen out for the phrase she uses to mean some people think cosmetic surgery solves all the problems…</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Felicity Mehendale, Consultant Plastic, Reconstructive &amp; Cleft Surgeon, The Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh</strong><br/>While I wouldn't wish for a world where people didn't have the option for cosmetic surgery what I worry about is that people potentially rush headlong into cosmetic surgery unaware of the fact that they might just have other choices. And I think there is so much focus on cosmetic surgery as maybe being the fix-all.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So Doctor Mehendale describes some people's view to cosmetic surgery as a 'fix-all' – so people who have chosen to have it done think it will solve all their problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And she talked about people rushing headlong into having surgery – meaning doing it quickly without thinking. Sometimes, there are other options.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>But there are still people who are prepared to pay the price for improving their looks. Celebrities such as Demi Moore, who was reported to have had a facelift, pay thousands of dollars to change their looks and keep looking young.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>But in the UK at least, the numbers of people having cosmetic surgery in the last year has been decreasing. Simon Withey, a consultant plastic surgeon, says there are many reasons for this – but which one does he hope is actually causing it?</p>\n<p><strong>Simon Withey, Consultant Plastic Surgeon, Royal Free Hospital, London</strong><br/>The news is good news, if it is that people are taking a more considered approach to this and are thinking more carefully and in some cases are deciding that it's not right for them – and patients are wiser and better informed. It's perhaps less good news if it means that patients are choosing a cheaper or less reputable, less experienced option. I'm an optimist so I hope it's that patients are becoming better informed and are making more considered and careful decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Simon Withey is an optimist – so a person who has positive and hopeful thoughts – and he hopes that people are becoming better informed and taking a more considered approach. That means they have given it a lot of thought before making a decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>That's better than a patient going straight for the cheapest option in which someone with less experience operates on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So knowing what is involved with cosmetic surgery is better than just rushing into it. Well I won't be rushing into it because there's something I know for sure – no amount of money will improve how I look – you see Neil, what you see is what you get!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes – you're not perfect Rob and you're not going to change - I'm well aware of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Shall we talk about your nose again? Have you thought anymore about that back street operation for a few pounds?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yeah, after having this discussion, you know Rob I think I'm going to keep my huge nose.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Good choice. We like you as you are.<br/>Well that brings to the end of our discussion about cosmetic surgery. We hope you've enjoyed it. See you again soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Both</strong><br/>Bye.</p> </div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And me, Finn. And today we’re talking about words that have more than one spelling. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's start by listening to Jack. He’s a professor of linguistics and he’s talking about changes in the English language.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: How do you think the word <strong>disc </strong>is usually spelt in British English?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jack<br/></strong></span><span>Today most of the influence on English spelling comes from North America. For example the words <strong>analogue, disc</strong>, <strong>enquire </strong>are <strong>spelt </strong>differently in American English. And these spellings are often used in British English too. And that’s generally <strong>all right</strong> by us. However, there are other spelling differences that we don’t think are correct in British English. For we Brits, it’s definitely wrong to spell <strong>colour</strong> or <strong>neighbour </strong>without the<strong> u</strong>. It’s also wrong to spell <strong>theatre</strong> in the American way.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we asked you: how is <strong>disc </strong>usually spelt in British English?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is that it’s usually spelt with a<strong> c</strong>, so<strong> d-i-s-c.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But in American English, it’s spelt <strong>d-i-s-k. </strong>So two different spellings there, but it's ok to spell <strong>disk</strong> with a <strong>k</strong> in British English when we're talking about computers and computing. What other words were mentioned? Let’s have our first clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jack    <br/></strong>For example the words <strong>analogue, disc</strong>, <strong>enquire </strong>are <strong>spelt </strong>differently in American English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So another computing term there: the word<strong> analogue</strong>, as in analogue clock, is spelt <strong>a-n-a-l-o-g-u-e</strong> in British English. But it’s spelt without the <strong>u-e</strong> in American English: so <strong>a-n-a-l-o-g</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And there are a few more words with different spellings in American and British English. We're not saying that one spelling is better than another…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>… but it's good to be aware of the differences. Now, the word<strong> enquire</strong>, meaning to ask about something, usually begins with the letter <strong>e</strong> in British English: <strong>e-n-q-u-i-r-e</strong>, whereas in American English it's spelt with an <strong>i</strong> at the beginning, not an <strong>e. </strong>Did you notice the word <strong>spelt</strong>? That’s the past participle of the verb <strong>spell</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that’s <strong>s-p-e-l-t</strong> in British English. But in North America, they prefer <strong>spelled</strong>, <strong>s-p-e-l-l-e-d</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We’re happy with both nowadays. You can choose which to use. It’s the same for other verbs like <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>dream </strong>and<strong> burn</strong>. You can say <strong>learnt, burnt </strong>and<strong> dreamt</strong> with a <strong>t </strong>at the end or <strong>learned, burned </strong>and<strong> dreamed</strong> with <strong>e-d</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>And there's a slight difference in pronunciation there too, isn't there?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, even in my best British accent you can hear the </span><span><strong>d</strong> and the <strong>t</strong> sounds at the end: <strong>burned</strong>,<strong> burnt</strong>.<strong> Learned</strong>,<strong> learnt</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Now some words have two spellings - but it’s nothing to do with American influence. Listen to this clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jack<br/></strong></span><span>And that’s generally <strong>all right</strong> by us.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And there we heard <strong>all right</strong>. You can spell that as two words, <strong>all</strong> and <strong>right</strong>. Or you can spell it as one word: <strong>a-l-r-i-g-h-t</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It's becoming quite common to see <strong>all right</strong> as two words, although some people still think that <strong>alright</strong> as one word is incorrect when writing.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Other words with two spellings are <strong>barbecue</strong>, meaning cooking food outdoors, spelt </span><span><strong>b-a-r-b-e-C-u-e </strong>or <strong>b-a-r-b-e-Q-u-e</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And there’s also <strong>racket</strong> as in tennis racket. It’s almost always spelt <strong>r-a-c-k-e-t</strong>, but it can be spelt <strong>r-a-c-q-u-e-t</strong> as well. One more clip please.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/>Jack<br/></span></strong><span>It’s definitely wrong to spell <strong>colour</strong> or <strong>neighbour </strong>without the<strong> u</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>colour</strong>, spelt<strong> c-o-l-o-u-r</strong> is <strong>c-o-l-o-r</strong> in American English. American spelling drops the <strong>u</strong> in words with <strong>o-u</strong> in them. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And there are a lot of words that end in <strong>r-e</strong> in British English but <strong>e-r</strong> in American English, like <strong>theatre</strong>,<strong> centre </strong>and<strong> kilometre</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And right now it’s quiz time! Number one: Everybody knows that if you play with fire, you might get burnt. But what are the two possible ways to spell the past participle of the verb <strong>burn</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>They’re <strong>b-u-r-n-t</strong> and <strong>b-u-r-n-e-d</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>Number two. How do we spell <strong>all right</strong> when it’s one word?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span><strong>a-l-r-i-g-h-t</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Number three: What’s the American English spelling of the word <strong>flavour</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It's <strong>f-l-a-v-o-r</strong> without the <strong>u</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Well done if you got those all right. And before we go, here’s a vocabulary tip. If you use a computer to write in English, use a spellchecker, and make sure you set it to your preferred variety of English. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p> </div>",

That spelling is generally accepted in British English too.</p>\n<p><strong>apologise</strong> (BrE) / <strong>apologize</strong> (AmE/BrE)</p>\n<p>The past form of some verbs can be spelt in two ways in British English. But the <strong>-ed</strong> ending is preferred in American English.</p>\n<p><strong>spelt</strong> (BrE) / <strong>spelled</strong> (AmE/BrE)</p>\n<p>Other words have two spellings, not from any American influence.</p>\n<p><strong>all right/alright</strong>, <strong>barbecue/barbeque</strong>, <strong>racket/racquet</strong></p>\n<p>Some American English spellings are not accepted as correct in British English. Two common examples are words with <strong>ou</strong> in them and words ending in <strong>-re</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>colour</strong> (BrE) / <strong>color</strong> (AmE), <strong>centre</strong> (BrE) / <strong>center</strong> (AmE)</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, how well do you know these differences? On the next page, we'll do a quiz about British and American English. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Theatre or theater?</h3>\n<p>Where would you go to watch a performance of Hamlet? To the <strong>theatre</strong>. Or is that... <strong>theater</strong>? Both spellings of this word are used, but the first one is British English and the second one is American English.</p>\n<p>In 6 Minute Vocabulary we heard that there are a lot of words which are often <strong>spelt</strong> differently in British and American English. <strong>Spelt</strong> was one of them. Take a look:</p>\n<p><strong>More common in British English</strong></p>\n<p>spelt<br>learnt<br/>burnt</br></p>\n<p><strong>More common in American English</strong></p>\n<p>spelled<br/>learned<br/>burned</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>What other tips do we have? Well, words which end <strong>-our</strong> in British English are usually spelt <strong>-or</strong> in American English. The <strong>-re</strong> ending in lots of British English words becomes <strong>-er</strong>. And verbs which end <strong>-ise</strong> in British English are spelt <strong>-ize</strong> in American.</p>\n<p><strong>British English</strong></p>\n<p>colour<br/>flavour</p>\n<p>theatre<br/>centre</p>\n<p>apologise<br/>organise</p>\n<p><strong>American English</strong></p>\n<p>color<br/>flavor</p>\n<p>theater<br/>center</p>\n<p>apologize<br/>organize</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the quiz below, you have to drag the words into the correct columns. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>We're not finished yet - there's one more activity to test your knowledge of different spellings - next!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Disc or disk?</h3>\n<p>Do you listen to music on CDs? Back in the year 2000, 2.5 billion music albums were sold on CD around the world. The number has fallen since then, but the <strong>compact disc </strong>is still used widely in the music industry.</p>\n<p>Another way to store information is on a <strong>hard disk</strong>. Your computer has one inside, and you can also buy an external hard disk if you need extra space.</p>\n<p>Just as technology changes over time, so does language. As you probably noticed we used two different spellings there - <strong>disc</strong> and <strong>disk</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Disk</strong> is generally used to talk about computing, and <strong>disc</strong> is used for CDs and when talking about machine parts. As we heard in 6 Minute Vocabulary, <strong>disk</strong> is more common in American English, but many people use either spelling in British English.</p>\n<p>The important thing to remember is that you will see both spellings! And whenever you learn a new word, check to see if it has more than one spelling.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, here are a few more for you: <strong>inquire / enquire</strong>, <strong>aging / ageing</strong>, and <strong>yoghurt / yogurt</strong>.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>So, you think you know your spelling? Time to test yourself! In this quiz each question has three options: two are acceptable spellings, and one is an incorrect spelling. You have to find the incorrect one. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>We hope you're now more confident at <strong>analysing / analyzing</strong> how words are <strong>spelt / spelled</strong>! Join us in the next session when we look at this unit's grammar: adverb position in sentences. In 6 Minute Grammar, Catherine's wearing a hat which is <strong>quite brightly</strong> coloured...</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me, <strong>Catherine</strong>. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I was just admiring your hat Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, do you like it?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Well, it's interesting, <strong>really</strong> interesting. It's <strong>quite</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured, isn't it? And <strong>very</strong> shiny.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Thank you, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Anyway, moving on. In today's programme we're going to be looking at adverbs and we'll focus on how they are used with adjectives, other adverbs and also look at a couple of categories of adverbs and their usual positions. Catherine, could you remind us what adverbs do and why they are important?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Certainly Callum. Adverbs give us more information about <strong>verbs</strong>, <strong>adjectives</strong> and other <strong>adverbs</strong>. And they're important because they help us to answer questions such as where? When? How? And how often? And adverbs can add colour and depth to what we say and write. For example, listen to this sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He picked up his coat and left. He picked up his coat and left.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, this is a perfectly good sentence, it's clear and grammatically correct. It tells us what happened but it's not very descriptive. Now listen again, only this time we're going to add some adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>. He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, so the adverb <strong>calmly </strong>is very descriptive. It tells us how the person did the action. And there's an adverbial phrase as well, did you spot it? Listen again.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>. He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and<strong> left without making a sound</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, did you spot the adverbial phrase?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It was 'without making a sound'.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. So these adverbs give us lots of information which, depending on the context, can be very dramatic and atmospheric.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>This is 6 Minute Grammar and today we're taking a look at the position of adverbs. Catherine, I want to take you back to your hat.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really, must you?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I'm afraid I must, but it's all in the cause of education.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>OK then.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong><br/>Can you remember how I described it?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. If I remember rightly you said my hat was <strong>really</strong> interesting, <strong>quite</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured and <strong>very</strong> shiny. Aah, Callum, I see what you've done there. You've given examples of adverbs being used with adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>You see, I'm not just a pretty face.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Mmm. Anyway, when we use adverbs to describe adjectives or other adverbs, they must go <strong>before</strong> the adjective or adverb being modified. So, <strong>interesting</strong> is an adjective, and the adverb you used was <strong>really</strong>. The adverb goes before the adjective so the correct form is <strong>really interesting</strong>. And it's the same with the adjective<strong> shiny</strong>. You used the adverb <strong>very</strong>. So <strong>very shiny </strong>is correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And we also had an example of using an adverb to add information to another adverb, didn't we?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We did Callum. You said my hat was <strong>very</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured. Again the modifying adverb, in this case, <strong>very</strong>, must go before the adverb being described.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I think we've got a little time to look at some different categories of adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We have, so let's start with adverbs like <strong>always</strong>,<strong> never</strong>, <strong>often</strong>, <strong>regularly </strong>and<strong> hardly ever</strong>. We call these adverbs of indefinite frequency and these are <strong>frequently</strong> used – oh, there's another one, <strong>frequently</strong>– these are frequently used before the main verb. There are two in this example, <strong>never </strong>and <strong>always</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I have <strong>never</strong> met anyone like you. I think I will <strong>always</strong> love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's compare adverbs of indefinite frequency to adverbs of definite frequency, like <strong>this week</strong>, <strong>this year</strong>, <strong>daily</strong>. Listen out for the position of <strong>daily </strong>in this example.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I ride my bike <strong>daily</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, these adverbs usually go in the third position, after the verb and object clause and not directly before the main verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Thanks Catherine. Now time for a short quiz to check some of today's points.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We're going to give some example sentences. What are the adverbs and are they in the correct place? Here's the first one.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He plays tennis well very.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The adverbs there are <strong>well </strong>and <strong>very</strong>. But the adverb <strong>very </strong>is in the wrong place. It should go before <strong>well</strong>. The correct sentence is: He plays tennis <strong>very well</strong>. Next example, please.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It was a dark blue car that nearly hit me.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The adverb there is <strong>dark</strong> and it was in the correct place. Final sentence, please.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I every day take the train to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the adverb there, <strong>every day</strong>, is not in the correct place. It needs to go after the verb clause. So: I take the train to work <strong>every day</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>You can find more about adverbs on our website <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And please join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Goodbye.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>One more question Catherine.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Adverbs with adjectives</h3>\n<p>If we go just by the name, we might think that <strong>adverbs</strong> are only used to modify or give more information about verbs.</p>\n<p>They are used with verbs, and you can read more about that <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-15/session-2\" target=\"_self\">here</a></strong>, but they are also used to modify adjectives.</p>\n<p>When using an adverb to talk about adjectives, the adverb goes <strong>before the adjective</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>I'm <strong>so</strong> glad you agreed to take the job.</em></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>I’ve had a <strong>very</strong> good day today.</em></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>It was a <strong>dark</strong> blue car that nearly hit me.</em> </p>\n<h3>Adverbs with adverbs</h3>\n<p>We also use adverbs to modify other adverbs. When we use adverbs like this, we put the modifying adverb <strong>before the other adverb</strong>. </p>\n<p><em>I'll <strong>probably</strong> never be able to buy the house of my dreams.</em></p>\n<p><em>That hat was <strong>very</strong> brightly coloured indeed!</em></p>\n<p><em><em>He was driving <strong>incredibly</strong> recklessly</em>.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>A <em>really</em> useful adverb</h3>\n<p>The adverb <strong>really</strong> is interesting, in fact you could say it's <em><strong>really</strong></em> interesting. Its meaning changes depending on the postion you use it in a sentence.</p>\n<p>When we use it before an adjective it has a meaning similiar to <strong>very</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>I was <strong>really</strong> upset when she didn't come to my party.</em></p>\n<p><em>'Really' is a <strong>really</strong> interesting adverb.<br/></em><br/>In other positions the meaning is different. It means something similar to <strong>actually </strong>or <strong>in fact</strong>, <strong>truly</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>I <strong>really</strong> do want to go, I wasn't joking.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>She <strong>really</strong> thought she'd passed this time, but I guess she'll have to take the exam again.</em></p>\n<p><em>Is she <strong>really</strong> going out with him?</em></p>\n<h3>Yet</h3>\n<p>We usually put the adverb <strong>yet </strong>in the third position in questions and negatives.</p>\n<p><em>Have you seen the doctor <strong>yet</strong>?</em></p>\n<p><em>I haven't done it <strong>yet</strong>.</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>See if you can spot correct uses of adverbs in our quiz. </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done if you got all those right. We have some more information about different kinds of adverbs in the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What do adverbs look like?</h3>\n<p>There are many different kinds of adverb and unfortunately there is nothing about their form that definitely identifies them as adverbs.</p>\n<p>Some adjectives can be turned in adverbs by <strong>adding -ly</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>It was a <strong>slow</strong> journey.</em> (adjective)<br><em>We drove <strong>slowly</strong> when it started to rain.</em> (adverb)</br></p>\n<p><strong>-ly adverbs</strong> are sometimes called <strong>adverbs of manner. </strong>They describe the way someone does something. Note though that not all words that end in –ly are adverbs, not all adverbs of manner end in -ly and not all adjectives can made into adverbs this way!</p>\n<h3>Not just a single word</h3>\n<p>Although many adverbs are just one word there are also adverbial phrases. These are groups of words that act as adverbs.</p>\n<p><em>We plan to leave <strong>the day after tomorrow</strong>.<br/></em><em>I'll meet you <strong>at the bus stop</strong>.<br/>He left <strong>without making a sound</strong>.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>More adverb positions</h3>\n<p>Let's take look at a couple of other groups of adverbs and where we put them in sentences.</p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Adverbs of place and adverbs of definite time and frequency</strong></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">These usually go in the third position. Some examples of these adverbs are:</p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>downstairs, over there, on the table, last week, daily</strong></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>I ride my bike <strong>daily</strong>.<br/>I'm sure I put my wallet <strong>on the table</strong>, but I can't find it now.</em></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Adverbs of indefinite frequency and degree adverbs</strong> <br/> These are frequently used in the second position. Some examples of these adverbs are:</p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>always, never, hardly ever, often, rarely, regularly, seldom, almost, hardly, nearly, quite, scarcely</strong></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>I will <strong>always</strong> love you.<br/></em><em>I had <strong>never</strong> seen anything like it.</em><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Adverbial phrases of time or frequency</strong></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Use these adverbs in the first or third positions, but not the second. Some examples of these adverbials are:</p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>from time to time, as a rule, every so often</strong></p>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong><em>From time to time</em></strong><em> I buy things online.<br/></em><em>I buy things online <strong>from time to time</strong>.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Adverb position 2</h3>\n<p>In Unit 15 we took a first look at the position of adverbs.

So it’s no surprise that an Instagram account which apparently belonged to a migrant travelling from Senegal to Europe <strong>captured people’s imaginations</strong>. He got many followers very quickly. But who were they actually following? Come with us to find out.</span></span></p>\n<h3><strong><span><span>To do</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>Read this article about the fake migrant profile. Then tell us: who is the man in the pictures? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong><span><span>Part 1<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Recent attempts by thousands of Africans and Syrians to reach Europe have been described in the media as a 'migrant crisis', attracting a huge amount of public interest. So it’s no surprise that some 8,000 social media users decided to follow the account in the name of Abdou Diouf from Dakar. Selfies started to appear online, claiming to show the dangerous journey of a young man seeking a better life.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 2<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>It was a good story – this migrant was <strong>putting the audience in his shoes</strong>. One day there he was – the smiling man with his family. Then, a haircut – maybe the last chance for <strong>grooming</strong> before the big adventure. But in the next chapter, drama! Abdou Diouf’s picture showed him in a dark place. The <strong>caption</strong>: “The only way to cross, a small inflatable boat all night rowing. Really scared.” We can guess that he was crossing the Mediterranean.  Another day, and he might have reached Europe – a new picture and a comment in <strong>broken English</strong>: “Finally the land os opportunities. We tired but happy, Very danger trip.”</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 3<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>The young man’s journey across continents was received with mixed reactions. One commentator left no doubt how he felt about migrants. He wrote in capital letters: “FED UP WITH ALL YOU MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET HERE, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU HERE AND NO WORK, NO DREAM.” Others encouraged the young man to keep going with comments like “I wish you the best” and “may God make it easy for you”.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 4<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>We can only imagine how people felt when it was revealed that the story was not true! The name on the account? It was borrowed from a former president of Senegal. The blog Disphotic, run by photographer and London College of Communication lecturer Lewis Bush, revealed that this migrant story was a <strong>hoax</strong>. Some of the <strong>hashtags</strong> used such as #LovingLife, #IllegalDreamer, #instalike and #instagramers looked a bit suspicious. The background on the photos and list of account contacts helped to <strong>give the game away</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 5<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>So who was this guy and what was he doing? The man in the pictures is said to be a Spanish citizen called Hagi Toure, a handball player who’s been living in the same city for more than 10 years. He was just playing a role. The city is Barcelona, the place where all the pictures were taken. The account in the name of Abdou Diouf was created by a Spanish advertising agency for a photography exhibition about travel. Tomas Pena, one of the project’s directors, told the BBC: “We cast a <strong>bunch</strong> of people to appear in the campaign”. He says the account had the objective of making Europeans think about their attitudes towards migrants travelling to Europe from Africa. “We treat them like animals, and looking at the comments, there are some really <strong>racist</strong> comments. It’s quite sad”, concludes Pena.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 6</strong><br/>Lewis Bush expressed concern for the hoax. “If an account like this is fake, where does that leave other bits of evidence of the <strong>hardships </strong>and dangers migrants face at home and during their <strong>odysseys </strong>to Europe?” The lesson for social media users might be to be less trusting about what they see online, while not turning their backs on the suffering of people in difficult situations which are real.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Answer to our question: </span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span><span>The man in the picture is Hagi Toure, a handball player who has been living in Barcelona for more than 10 years.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <br><span>Hi this is Finn, with another guide to real, spoken English. This time, how to say <strong>sorry</strong>. Now, we all make mistakes, but how we say sorry is very important.</span></br></p>\n<p><span>Now, being polite people, the British do say sorry quite a lot. <strong>I'm sorry, have you got the time?</strong> <strong>I'm sorry – do you know where Oxford Circus station is?</strong> But those are more like saying <strong>excuse me</strong>. 'I'm sorry, have you got the time?' is like: 'Excuse me, have you got the time?'</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, let's look at a few situations where people really do mean <strong>sorry</strong>, and the different ways the word is used.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rob and Neil are going to apologise to each other quite a lot in these examples. </span></p>\n<p><span>So, first, Neil apologises to Rob. They've agreed to meet at a cafe. What does Neil say?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Hi Rob, <strong>sorry I'm late</strong>. The train was supposed to get here 30 minutes ago. But you know how it is… horrible delays, I'm afraid.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/></strong>Oh that's ok.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn <br/>Sorry I'm late</strong>. Now that might be the most common apology you'll hear in English! Sorry I'm late! You could also use this pattern <strong>sorry I'm…</strong> to say other things like <strong>sorry I'm slow</strong>, or <strong>sorry I'm not very good at this</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Hmm... right. Now's it's Rob's turn to apologise to Neil. Rob has borrowed Neil's bike – but something bad happened. What was it?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/></strong>Neil, I've got something to tell you. You know how you lent me your bike? </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Uh huh...</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I don't have it. It was stolen. And <strong>I'm really sorry</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Right.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/>I'm so sorry about this</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Rob, you're an idiot.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><br/>The bike was stolen. And Neil sounds a bit angry. And did you notice how Rob apologised? Well first, he prepared Neil for the apology by saying:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>Neil, I've got something to tell you.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><br/>Now, when someone hears this, they know something serious is coming next. So, next, the apology itself. And this was just a simple sentence.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>I'm really sorry.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><strong><br/>I'm really sorry</strong>. You could also say <strong>I'm so sorry</strong>. Or just, <strong>I'm sorry</strong>. Or just <strong>sorry</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>Well, I don't have it. It was stolen. And <strong>I'm really sorry</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Right.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/>I'm so sorry about this</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>I'm so sorry about this</strong>. In English, you often say you're sorry 'about' something – listen to these…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>I'm sorry about</em></strong><em> the flowers.<br/></em></span><span><strong><em>I'm sorry about</em></strong><em> the cake. I cooked it for too long.<br/></em></span><span><strong><em>I'm sorry about</em></strong><em> the mess on the floor.</em></span></p>\n<p><span>Right, we're almost there – but remember Neil called Rob an idiot? Well, Neil feels bad. It's Neil's turn to apologise to Rob. How does he do it?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>Ah... Rob. <strong>I really want to apologise for</strong> what I said earlier. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><br/>So Neil said: <strong>\"I want to apologise for </strong>what I said\". Lots of people do this in English. It's a way of saying sorry, without using the word 'sorry'. I want to apologise for being late, I want to apologise for the mess on the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span>But Neil actually did say sorry afterwards. He said:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>I'm really sorry for calling you an idiot.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span> <br/>Sorry for calling you an idiot. Now, sorry for… can be followed by a verb in the –ing form, like Neil used it there: <strong>\"Sorry for calling you an idiot\"</strong>. Or it can be followed by a noun. Listen to these:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Sorry for </em></strong><em>making you late.<br/></em></span><span><strong><em>Sorry for</em></strong><em> the mess on the floor.</em></span></p>\n<p><span>So there we go – lots of different ways to say sorry:</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span>I'm sorry</span></em></strong><em> <span><strong><br/>I'm really sorry</strong> <strong><br/>I'm so sorry</strong> <strong><br/>sorry about something</strong> <strong><br/>sorry for something</strong> <br/>and <strong>I want to apologise for something</strong>.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>And there we are. <strong>I'm really sorry</strong> but I have to go now. Bye.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here's the whole conversation of Neil and Rob again:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Hi Rob, <strong>sorry I'm late</strong>. The train was supposed to get here 30 minutes ago. But you know how it is… horrible delays, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob <br/></strong>Oh that's ok. <span>Neil, I've got something to tell you. You know how you lent me your bike? Well, I don't have it. It was stolen. And <strong>I'm really sorry</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Right.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/>I'm so sorry about this</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Rob, you're an idiot... </span><span>Rob. <strong>I really want to apologise for </strong>what I said earlier. <strong>I'm really sorry for</strong> calling you an idiot.</span></p>\n<p> </p> </div>",

Normally this is followed by a verb in the -ing form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sorry for losing your bike</li>\n<li>Sorry for being so smelly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5) Saying sorry without saying sorry – <strong>I apologise for...</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I apologise for calling you an idiot. It wasn't very nice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed learning about these simple ways to apologize.</p>\n<p>In Session 5 we have Part 9 of our drama, <strong>The Importance of Being Earnest</strong>.</p></div>",

And this programme is all about linking words, the words and phrases we use to connect ideas and events when we speak or write.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, we call them linking words and phrases. They help people to follow what we’re saying by showing how ideas are connected to each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>First</strong>, we’ll look at some examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Next</strong>, there will be a short quiz…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And <strong>finally</strong>, we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary. </p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>But to start with, let’s listen to Angela talking about a lucky escape she had. While you listen, try to answer this question: who or what saved Angela in the end?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Here’s Angela.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Presenter<br/></strong>So Angela, tell us: what did you escape from?<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> </strong>A shark.</p>\n<p><strong>Presenter<br/> Wow! Really…?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> </strong>Yes, <strong>what happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden,</strong> I saw a huge black shape coming towards me. <strong>To begin with</strong>, I thought it was a dolphin…</p>\n<p><strong>Presenter<br/> </strong>But it wasn’t. So, <strong>what happened next</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> </strong>Well, I <strong>then</strong> quickly realised it was a shark. <strong>Luckily</strong>, I’m a very fast swimmer. But <strong>in the end</strong>, it was a boat that saved me.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>That’s an incredible story! We asked: who or what saved Angela?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It was a boat. Angela said “<strong>In the end</strong>, a boat saved me.”</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Lucky lady. Now Angela helped us to follow her story by using linking words and phrases to tell us what happened, when it happened and how she felt about it. Let’s have a look at some of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>OK, right, now the first one was right at the beginning. Angela said \"<strong>What happened was…</strong>\"and this is a really good way tointroduce a story because it grabs the listener’s attention and it tells them to get ready to hear a story. Have a listen.</p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> What happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, I saw a huge black shape coming towards me.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>OK, good start. Now another way to tell your story clearly is to say words that show the order of events. Catherine and I did this at the beginning of this programme when we used words like <strong>First</strong>, <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Finally</strong>: <strong>First</strong>, we’ll look at examples …,</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> Next</strong>, there will be a short quiz… </p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And <strong>finally</strong>, we’ll leave you with a top tip…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. Now let’s listen to how Angela used words and phrases like these.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> What happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden,</strong> I saw a huge black shape coming towards me. <strong>To begin with</strong>, I thought it was a dolphin…</p>\n<p><strong>Presenter<br/> </strong>But it wasn’t. So, <strong>what happened next</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> </strong>Well, I <strong>then</strong> quickly realised it was a shark. <strong>Luckily,</strong> I’m a very fast swimmer. But <strong>in the end</strong>, it was a boat that saved me.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>So, when you get to the end of your story use a phrase like <strong>in the end </strong>or <strong>finally </strong>to show that your story’s about to finish.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Angela<br/> </strong>But in the end it was a boat that saved me.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>OK. Now, let’s hear Angela tell us about how the boat saved her.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT                  <br/> <br/> Angela<br/> Fortunately</strong>, the boat had already seen the shark and fired a rocket, which scared the creature off.</p>\n<p><strong>Presenter<br/> </strong>That was lucky!</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Wow, so Angela uses the adverb <strong>fortunately</strong> as a linking word to comment on this.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>            <br/> Yes and in the first clip Angela said: \"<strong>Luckily, I’m a fast swimmer</strong>.\" Other comment adverbs you may hear include <strong>unfortunately</strong>, <strong>sadly </strong>and so on.  And we can also use adverbs and adverbial phrases like <strong>suddenly</strong> or <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, which we heard in the first clip to say how things happen.</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>We’re talking about words and phrases that link different sentences and parts of a story.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Yep and it’s time for a quick recap. So, to start a story we had…</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> Well, what happened was</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>For ordering events:</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> First of all, to begin with, then, next, after that…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>To finish a story…</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> Finally, in the end.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>To make a comment:</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> Luckily, unfortunately, sadly</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And lastly we had:</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong><strong>Suddenly, all of a sudden</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>            <br/>Great, now it’s quiz time. Choose the correct linking word or phrase to fill the gaps. Number one: I tried for weeks to get a ticket to the final. [sfx: beep] I gave up. Is it a) In the end or b) Next.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>     <br/>It’s a) <strong>In the end</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>       <br/>Well done. Number two. It started to rain. [sfx: beep] I had an umbrella with me. Is it a) Suddenly or b) Luckily.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>           <br/>It’s b) <strong>Luckily</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>           <br/>Finally, number 3: Which is the correct phrase to introduce your story? Is it a) What happened was … or b) What happened it … ?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>           <br/>And it’s a) <strong>What happened was</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It is, and well done to you if you got those right. Now before we finish here’s Rob with a quick tip for learning vocabulary.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>           <br/>Yes, why not make a note of new linking devices when hear other people speak English – on the bus, waiting in a queue or watching TV. Note them on your phone or just write them down somewhere and then try to use them yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>           <br/>Top tip Rob, thank you.

I had a shower.</p>\n<p>I got up <strong>and</strong> had a shower.</p>\n<p>Both are correct but the second is more natural and easier to read. Two short sentences have been joined together to make a longer one. As the subject of each sentence is the same (<strong>I</strong>) we don't have to repeat the personal pronoun. </p>\n<h3>And is not the only link</h3>\n<p>Although using <strong>and</strong> can be better than having two short sentences, we don't want to use it too much. </p>\n<p>I got up <strong>and</strong> had a shower <strong>and</strong> got dressed <strong>and</strong> had breakfast <strong>and</strong> left for work.</p>\n<p>Again, this sentence is grammatically correct but it's not good English. Too many <strong>ands</strong>. In a case like this there are a number of different linking words we can use to describe this sequence of events.</p>\n<p>I got up <strong>then </strong>had a shower. <strong>After that </strong>I got dressed <strong>before</strong> having breakast <strong>and</strong> leaving for work.</p>\n<p>This is a better sentence as it uses a variety of linking words and phrases. Note that in this sentence after the preposition <strong>before </strong>we can use the gerund (ing) form of the verb. </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>First to last</h3>\n<p>Here are some linking words and phrases that can be used to talk about the order that something happens.</p>\n<p>To start:</p>\n<p><strong>To begin with, first, at first, to start with</strong></p>\n<p>To continue:</p>\n<p><strong>Next, then, afterwards, after that/this, later, and</strong></p>\n<p>At the same time:</p>\n<p><strong>While, as, during, at that moment, </strong></p>\n<p>To finish:</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, lastly, in the end</strong></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the quiz you will need to use the best linking word to complete the sentences. The sentences are based on the events of this paragraph.</p>\n<p><strong>The holiday</strong></p>\n<p>\"Before we left for our holiday there was a lot to do. We had packed the night before to save time in the morning. The alarm was set for 6 o'clock but I got up at 5.30, showered, had breakfast and loaded the car. At 8.00 we dropped the dog off at the kennel. We drove to the garage. I checked the tyre pressures, at the same time my wife filled the tank with petrol. I paid for the petrol and bought some snacks for the journey. We started on our journey at 9.00 and arrived at our holiday cottage 12 hours later.\"</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Stating the obvious</h3>\n<p>There are a number of linking words and phrases we use when we think that something is easily understood. </p>\n<p>Look at this sentence:</p>\n<p>\"Property prices are very high at the moment. <strong>C</strong><strong>learly</strong> this is a bad thing if you are trying to get your foot on the property ladder.\"</p>\n<p>If you leave out the word <strong>clearly</strong> the sentence still makes sense, so what does it add?</p>\n<p>The adverb <strong>clearly </strong>links the two parts of the sentence and tells us what the writer is thinking. There is more than just fact here. The writer is suggesting that it is <strong>obvious</strong> and everyone will understand that high property prices are a bad thing. It is an invitation for the reader to agree with the writer and share his or her opinion.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>I'm sure you'll agree</h3>\n<p>Here are some more examples of linking words and phrases we can use when we expect people to agree with us.</p>\n<p><strong>obviously, naturally, as you might expect, as you can imagine, of course<br><br/></br></strong></p>\n<p>See how they are used in this short story.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't believe it, what happened was this. The other day I had an interview for a job, a really good job. <strong>Naturally</strong> I wanted to make a good impression so I wore my best suit. I looked great, <strong>of course</strong>.</p>\n<p>I left home in good time, you know how bad the traffic can be, and I got to the interview two hours early. <strong>Clearly </strong>I couldn't wait outside for two hours. <strong>As you might expect </strong>I was very nervous about the interview so I decided to calm my nerves and pass the time by going for walk along the river.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I wasn't paying attention and I slipped and fell, right into the river. I was soaked and my clothes were ruined. <strong>As you can imagine</strong> I was mortified. I didn't have enough time to go home and get changed so I just had to go to the interview in my wet clothes, looking like a drowned rat. <strong>Obviously</strong> I realised I would never get the job but you know what, I did! <strong>Clearly </strong>I must have made a good impression.\"</p>\n<p>The use of these linking words makes the story <strong>more personal</strong> and <strong>involves the reader</strong>. They add <strong>colour and opinion</strong>. More than the facts we can read how the person in the story feels about those facts.</p>\n<h3>To do<strong><br/></strong></h3>\n<p>Now it's your turn. In the quiz you need to choose the best linking word or phrase to complete each sentence. The answers could be linking words from any of the activities in this session.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session on linking words. Next, we look at the grammar of telling stories. Why not give it go by clicking to the next session.</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><strong>  </strong><strong><span> <br/></span></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine    <br/></span></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>In today’s programme we’re talking about narrative tenses…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>Yes, narrative tenses. That means the past simple tense, the past continuous, the past perfect and the past perfect continuous.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>Yes, we use these tenses to describe events that happened in the past, and for telling stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>We’ll explain when to use each tense…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>…we’ll give you lots of examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>…and there’ll be quiz at the end of the show, so listen carefully! Let’s begin with the past simple. We use the past simple tense for events and actions that started and finished in the past. Here’s Mike with our first example.</p>\n<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>  <br/></span>I had a terrible day last Monday! It all started when I woke up late.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>So those three verbs: <strong>had</strong>, <strong>started</strong> and <strong>woke up</strong>, are all in the past simple, because they describe events which started and finished in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>   <br/>Now if Mike wants to describe the background to his story, or to talk about things that started before his story started, and continued through his story, he can use the past continuous tense, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>  <br/></span>It all started when I woke up late. I opened the curtains. It was raining and the traffic was moving very slowly.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>So that’s <strong>it was raining</strong> and <strong>the traffic was moving</strong>, in the past continuous, to set the scene and describe past activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>We’ll come back to the past continuous a little later on, but first, let’s look at two more tenses. First, the past perfect. Mike.</p>\n<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>  <br/></span>When I looked at my phone, I realised I had slept through the alarm!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>So, Mike used the past perfect <strong>I had slept </strong>with the past simple <strong>when I looked</strong> and another past simple <strong>I realised</strong> to show one past action happened before another one.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>That's right. So, first, Mike slept through his alarm, then he looked at his watch and realised. Mike swaps the order of events in his sentence, and uses the past perfect tense to signal that the second thing he talks about actually happened first. One more time please Mike?</p>\n<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>  <br/></span>When I looked at my phone, I realised I had slept through the alarm!</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>The past perfect continuous works in pretty much the same way, but this time for activities that continued for a length of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>              <br/></span>When I looked at my phone, I realised I had slept through the alarm. I had been sleeping like a log!</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Mike <strong>had been sleeping</strong> like a log. A past activity that continued for a length of time, before another past event. So we use a range of tenses to build up a story about past events. Let’s demonstrate this now. Catherine, tell me something that happened to you today …</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>Ok, Finn. Well, funnily enough, while I was walking to work this morning, I saw a monkey in a tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>You never did.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>I did.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>I don’t believe you.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>It’s true.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>OK. Catherine combined the past continuous <strong>I was walking</strong> with the past simple <strong>I saw.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That’s right, and I did that to show that one action happened whilst another one was still happening.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>   <br/></span>For interrupted activities, in other words. So, Catherine, what happened next?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>    <br/></span>Well, a man told me that the monkey had chased a cat up a tree.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Really?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Right.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>It's all in the past</h3>\n<p>We tell stories and anecdotes all the time. Maybe we're telling stories to our children, telling an amusing anecdote to entertain our friends or even simply saying what we did at the weekend.</p>\n<p>One thing is common to all these different kinds of stories. That's the past. They all happened in the past. Therefore,  it's very important to know the past verb forms and use them correctly. </p>\n<p>Can you identify the past verb forms in the following paragraph?</p>\n<p><strong><br/></strong>I <strong>was walking</strong> down the street to the shops. I <strong>hadn't been walking</strong> for very long when it <strong>started</strong> to pour down. I <strong>had forgotten</strong> to bring my umbrella so I <strong>got </strong>drenched. </p>\n<p><strong>was walking </strong>= past continuous</p>\n<p><strong>hadn't been walking</strong> = past perfect continuous</p>\n<p><strong>started</strong> = past simple</p>\n<p><strong>had forgotten</strong> = past perfect simple</p>\n<p><strong>got </strong>= past simple</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Past forms, a reminder</h3>\n<p>The <strong>past simple</strong> is used when there is <strong>a completed action in the past</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>It <strong>started</strong> to pour down. </em>(The starting of the rain is a finished event in the past)<br/><em>I <strong>got</strong> drenched. </em>(Getting drenched is a finished event in the past)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>past perfect simple</strong> is used to show that one action in the past happened before another action in the past.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I <strong>had forgotten</strong> to bring my umbrella. </em>(Forgetting the umbrella happened before the rain started)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>continuous verb forms</strong> are used when actions continued for a period of time and when actions in the past are interrupted by other actions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I <strong>was walking</strong> down the street to the shops. </em>(The activity of walking continued for a period of time)</li>\n<li><em>I <strong>hadn't been walking</strong> for very long when it started to pour down. </em>(The walk started before and was in progress when the rain started)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the activity you are going to read about a fishing trip. In each part of the story choose the correct verb form to complete the sentence. </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>You've seen the past verb forms that we use to tell stories. Now you are ready to learn about how we can also use the present to talk about the past. Yes, really!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>A horse walks into a bar ...</h3>\n<p>There is a genre of short jokes in English that involve people or animals walking into bars. The barman then makes some comment about the customer.</p>\n<p>The joke is often language based. To understand these jokes you usually need to understand the different meanings that words and expressions have. There is often a play between literal and idiomatic meanings. Take this joke for example:</p>\n<p><em>A horse walks into a bar. The barman says: \"Why the long face?\"</em></p>\n<p>Hilarious, isn't it!</p>\n<p>To understand this you need to know that if someone <strong>has a long face </strong>it means they look sad. This is the idiomatic meaning. A horse, of course, has a long face, not idiomatically but really.</p>\n<p>OK, this might not be the funniest joke ever, but it does demonstrate an interesting grammar point. </p>\n<p>Look at the verb forms in the joke:</p>\n<p><em>A horse <strong>walks</strong> into a bar. The barman <strong>says</strong>: \"Why the long face?\"</em></p>\n<p>They are present.</p>\n<p>In informal <strong>spoken</strong> English it's very common to use present verbs forms when we are <strong>telling jokes</strong>. This is also true for <strong>stories</strong> and <strong>anecdotes </strong>and also when<strong> </strong>talking about the plots of <strong>films</strong> and <strong>books</strong>.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Present for the past</h3>\n<p>Read this description of an unusual event. What do you notice about the verb forms?</p>\n<p><em>\"So last Sunday I'm on my way to the shops when I see the strangest thing. There's a giraffe. And it's just walking down the street as if it's on the way to the shops too. I take a picture of it and before you know it my photo goes viral. It's on social media, it's on the news. It's in the papers on Monday and on Tuesday I'm on televsion talking about it. What a week!\"</em></p>\n<p>Everything that's described here happened in the past however there are no past verb forms. Present verb forms are used throughout.</p>\n<p>Using the present for past events makes the story more engaging and more personal. It's typical in <strong>informal spoken English</strong>.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you remember the story of the man and his grandad going fishing in the last activity? In this quiz you're going to tell the story again only this time using present verb forms where appropriate.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to sit back, relax and listen to Catherine and Finn talking about the topic of narrative verb forms in 6 Minute Grammar.

I was late because I'd left my travel pass at home, so I'd had to run home to get my travel pass before I actually managed to get onto the tube - and that made me late. And then when I got to work, I was running along the corridor when I noticed that the lift door was open, so I <strong>sprinted</strong> and just managed to get into the lift and, you know, I was exhausted. And the lift started going up and then it just kind of, came to a stop – it broke down. I thought 'oh no' today's really not my day, I'm so unlucky. I couldn't believe it: I was going to be late after all. And I looked up to see the other people in the lift and I couldn't believe it, the only other person in the lift with me was Paul McCartney – the ex-Beatle Paul McCartney was standing in the lift with me. He just looked at me and said \"Let it be\".<br/><br/><strong>Catherine's story</strong><br/><br/>Hello, Catherine here. I'm going to tell you the story of how cricket saved my grandfather's life. The story happened in the 2nd World War when my grandfather was <strong>called up</strong> to serve in the army as a young man and he went to the training camp to do six weeks of basic training in the UK. Then all of the people in the army with him got told they were going to sail on a ship to Singapore to fight in the war. The day before they sailed the army people - trainees - had a cricket match against the local police force, and my grandfather played in this cricket match and did very well, and he scored about 68 not out, which I am told is a very good score in cricket. And the commander of the army or captain or whoever, called my grandfather to his office and said that was a very good <strong>innings</strong>, in fact it was so good that you're not going to go to Singapore tomorrow, you're going to stay with me and play on the cricket team. So my grandfather actually spent the rest of the Second World War in the UK working in a supplies store and playing cricket for the army, which was a good result for him especially because when the ship sailed to Singapore the next day, it was <strong>torpedoed</strong> and sank and terribly, everyone on the ship lost their lives. So cricket really did save my grandfather's life.<br/><br/><strong>Rob's story</strong><br/><br/>Hello Rob here. I've got a story about an embarrassing situation I got myself into. Before I worked at the BBC, I used to be a <strong>bookkeeper</strong> – surprising isn't it?! – but I almost wasn't. You see I applied for a job to be a bookkeeper and I filled in the application form and waited anxiously to see if I'd get an interview. Well I got an interview and I was asked to turn up at a farm, which seemed a bit odd to me, but I wanted a job so I went to this place dressed in a suit. And when I got there I started thinking \"this is a strange place for a job as a bookkeeper\". Anyway, I met these two guys and the interview started and it was after I was asked the first question that <strong>it dawned on me</strong> that I wasn't being interviewed for a job as a bookkeeper. You see they asked me to talk about a time when I'd managed a <strong>hive</strong>. Yeah, the job wasn't as a bookkeeper but it was to be a beekeeper. Can you imagine how embarrassed I felt - so I had to make my excuses and leave!</p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Who do you believe?</strong></h3>\n<p>Neil, Catherine and Rob all have some interesting and sometimes amusing stories to tell you but how true are they? Have a listen to them here and work out which one is fact and which ones are <strong>fiction</strong>. Only one story is fact - that is, it really happened. As you listen see if you can spot the narrative tenses being used.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>So who was telling the truth? Even if a story sounds unbelievable, it may be true - and that is the case with Catherine's story. Her grandfather really didn't go to war because of his superb cricket skills. But Rob and Neil's stories were just fictional - they were made up!</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Even though some of these stories were made up, it's time to test your understanding of what you heard by completing this activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Your turn!<br/></strong></h3>\n<p>Now we want to hear your stories - let us know if they are true or false! We'll see if other people can work out if you're telling porky pies (lies).</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Lineda, France</h3>\n<p>I'm going to tell you about something that happened to me.</p>\n<p>Last week-end I travelled to visit my relatives by train and I was reading an interesting detective novel. All of a sudden the man stood up, we sat opposite one another. While he was going away he gave me a wink and left a folded piece of paper on his seat.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine I was surprised and I thought that the content of the paper was his telephone number. After that I picked up the piece of paper and read it. He had already read the book and wrote the killer’s name. Obviously I didn't want to know the killer's name and wanted to keep the story's plot.</p>\n<h3>Vincenzo Peccerillo, Italy</h3>\n<p>Last month I spent some days at my parents' house. On a Sunday morning I was getting ready to go out when I suddenly heard strange rumours. I had just started the washing machine, so I assumed that something was going wrong with its operation. However, after a few seconds I understood that the rumours were coming from the outside. I opened the house's door and discovered that a woman was staying trapped in the lift, together with her dog. She was hitting on the lift internal walls, trying to attract someone's attention. Her dog was very nervous, and its barks almost covered her voice! I offered to dial the emergency number, but she asked me to warn her husband right away. I moved to her apartment immediately. After being informed, her husband didn't appear very worried... He seemed quite annoyed by my intrusion instead! I went back to the lift and pushed the call button, as suggested by the entrapped woman. Surprisingly, the lift started moving! Everything came good in the end... However, I had to return home quickly, because the dog looked very angry with me!</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>Is this story true or false?</p>\n<p>I know that what I am going to tell might be incredible, but this was the seventh year in a row that I was awarded the B.L. prize. I was sitting in my place when I heard the ritual words \"and the winner is...\" and, after my name was pronounced, I headed for the presenter to pick up the prize. While Photographers was taking pictures of me, I shook hands with very famous people such as Bono Vox, George Clooney and Angelina Jolie. Obviously, I had to make a speech to the audience and the millions of people watching TV.</p>\n<p>It was a compelling experience. What? Haven't you ever heard of The B.L. prize?<em> </em></p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos</h3>\n<p>When I was younger I jumped in parachute some times. I had to travel from Madrid to San Chidrián every weekend for two months to get the license and experience. It was funny but first time I jumped things were different that we had prepared. Rookies had preference to get on a plane so a friend and I were waiting for our moment when suddenly two men dressed in suits made a corridor with his arms and they permitted to get on the plane to other paratrooper that I'd never seen before.</p>\n<p>Our coach was at his side, the unknown paratrooper was as young as we were, he was tall and he had problems with the helmet because of his hair. The coach accompanied him during the flight. We saw him other times but he never joined us. He was the son of a minister and the last year he was the minister of justice here.</p>\n<h3>Anastasiya, Russia</h3>\n<p>Is this a true story?</p>\n<p>When I was a student, I was really short of money. I had to have an evening part-time work at the nursery. What happen was one day children had gone home with their parents, the last boy stayed there. It was about time to close our nursery, the boy was tired and wanted to his mum, he was crying a little. Finally I saw an old woman coming through the gate. She asked me, where Alex was. I thought the boy was her grandson. I asked her to give me his mum`s permission to take the boy and brought him. All of a sudden she began shouting at me.  She screamed, that it wasn`t Alex, where her sweet boy was and what I had done with him. She called me stupid girl and so on. Can you imagine it? There was no one around, I had only one little crying boy two or three years old. He couldn`t speak and couldn`t tell me anything. The woman told me, that she lived in another town and came to visit her daughter and grandson. And then it dawned on me. There were two kindergartens in our street, separated by an alley.  I asked her, how old Alex was. She replied that he was six. Our kindergarten was for children from two to four. I explained her how she could find another kindergarten where her dearest Alex was missing  her.</p>\n<p>But It wasn`t the end of the story, because I still had the crying boy with me. It was too late. I took his hand and we went together along the street to his block of flats. I must admit, it was against the rules. I would have to call the police in order to find his parents. But it would take plenty of time. Previously I had found out that the boy lived nearby.  After five minutes I knocked on the door of his flat. Another old woman asked me what I needed. I told her that I was from a kindergarten, I had a boy with me, he was her grandson and he wanted to go home. After that I had a strong sense of déjà vu. Because this woman started screaming. And I was called a stupid girl again. She didn`t open the door and told me, that his father had taken her grandson and they were watching TV in boy`s bedroom. I was really stunned. Fortunately the boy burst into tears: ‘Granny Anna! Granny Anna!’  She opened the door and hugged her grandson. His father was a trucker. He was so exhausted after long  journey, that just wanted to have a little nap. He had just overslept. Granny came home and began cooking. She didn`t realise that the man was sleeping and the boy wasn`t at home. She thought that everything quiet so they were watching TV.</p>\n<h3>Maan, UAE</h3>\n<p>Is this a true story?</p>\n<p>I had been in France for two years when I visited Monaco. I wanted to play Roulette in the Casino so I got in with my friends while my wife was taking care of our son outside. Although i have never played before and i didn't know the rules, I won. When i got out my wife was so angry and I realised that I forgot them waiting in the car until 3:00 am. I never gambled after that again. </p>\n<h3>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Is this a true story?</p>\n<p>I was really young and lived with my parents in a old house. Once time I was coming back from a party at midnight when I heard a odd sound. I didn't know what was that then I began to run very fast. While I was running I saw a old lady running beside me. I couldn't believe... She was a ghost of lady that had died long time ago. Luckily the ghost  vanished and I came back home safe.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos</h3>\n<p>Is this story true?</p>\n<p>Hello everybody. My story is about a funny situation that I had several years ago before of wedding with my ex-wife. I and my twin brother used to go to several nightclubs with our respective girlfriends , but the first time that I went, his girlfriend (my brother's girlfriend) didn't know that I am his brother.</p>\n<p>I had been waiting to my girlfriend for long time at the club but suddenly one strange woman began to kiss me. she was kissing me when my girlfriend arrived with her friends. She just looked at me and started to ask me, who is that girl? I tried to explain her but I couldn't because I was very confused.</p>\n<p>Fortunately my brother arrived at the club and our girlfriends realized that we are twins brother.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">End of Session 3</strong></p>\n<p>That's all for this session. Join us in Session 4 where we look at word and phrases to express surprise and disbelief - and learn how to pronounce them properly.</p></div>",

It's important to use your voice to make sure you sound surprised! To sound surprised, make your voice a little bit louder than normal and use a wider range of intonation than normal. If your voice is too flat, then these expressions will sound strange. But beware: if you sound surprised when the information isn't very surprising, you will also sound strange.

In this programme, we’re talking about misspelt words.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Let's start by listening to Marcus. He's talking about his last holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And here’s a question for while you’re listening: What was the weather like on Marcus’s holiday?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marcus<br/></strong>Last year we decided to have a <strong>foreign</strong> holiday. We <strong>travelled</strong> by coach to Rome and the <strong>scenery</strong> in northern Italy was beautiful. Our hotel <strong>accommodation</strong> was great, and we had some <strong>wonderful</strong> meals in <strong>restaurants</strong>. The weather was a bit <strong>changeable</strong> until the third day but it didn’t matter. We got to <strong>practise</strong> our Italian and it’s a lot better now. The whole thing was a great <strong>experience</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We asked you: What was the weather like on Marcus’s holiday?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is that the weather was a bit <strong>changeable</strong> and that brings us to our first common spelling mistake. <strong>Changeable</strong> is spelt <strong>c-h-a-n-g-E-a-b-l-e</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, there are quite a lot of words with the letters <strong>g-e</strong> in them, and the <strong>e</strong> shows that the <strong>g</strong> is pronounced softly as /dʒ/, chan<strong>ge</strong>able.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Other examples of words with <strong>g-e</strong> in the middle are <strong>manageable, management, knowledgeable </strong>and <strong>acknowledgement. </strong>And they all have the <strong>e</strong> after the <strong>g</strong>.  But what other words with tricky spellings did we hear? Listen.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1         <br/></strong>Last year we decided to have a <strong>foreign</strong> holiday. We <strong>travelled</strong> by coach to Rome and the <strong>scenery</strong> in northern Italy was beautiful. Our hotel <strong>accommodation</strong> was great, and we had some <strong>wonderful</strong> meals in <strong>restaurants</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now the spelling of<strong> foreign </strong>is interesting. There’s a spelling rule that says you must put <strong>i</strong> before <strong>e</strong> except after <strong>c</strong>. And that’s a really good rule for lots of words.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Like <strong>believe</strong>, spelt <strong>b-e-l-I-E-v-e</strong> and <strong>receive </strong>spelt <strong>r-e-c-E-I-v-e</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Exactly. Or <strong>field </strong>spelt <strong>f-i-e-l-d</strong> but <strong>ceiling</strong>, with a c, <strong>c-e-i-l-i-n-g.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, so<strong> foreign</strong> breaks the rule, doesn’t it?  It’s spelt <strong>f-o-r-e-i-g-n</strong>. And there’s no letter <strong>c </strong>there.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No, that’s an exception.And there are a few others like<strong> leisure </strong>and <strong>weird. </strong>They both have<strong> e-i -</strong>but not after a<strong> c. </strong>It’s really worth learning these.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>What other tricky spellings were there in that clip? We heard<strong> travelled. </strong>How many  <strong>l</strong>s are there in travelled?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>There are two. In British English, with verbs that end in a vowel before <strong>l</strong> or <strong>r</strong>, we double the final consonants when we make them into past or continuous forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Finally there were three nouns that can cause spelling problems. What were they, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They were be <strong>scenery, accommodation</strong> and <strong>restaurants</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>Scenery </strong>starts with an<strong> s </strong>sound, but it is spelt with<strong> s-c .</strong> It’s easy to forget the <strong>c </strong>because you don’t hear it. The words <strong>science</strong> and <strong>scissors</strong> are the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now <strong>accommodation </strong>has a double <strong>c </strong>and a double <strong>m</strong> and <strong>restaurant</strong> has the letters <strong>au</strong> in the middle. No rule for these I’m afraid! They just have to be learnt. Next clip!</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>We got to <strong>practise</strong> our Italian and it’s a lot better now. The whole thing was a great <strong>experience.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So how do you spell the verb <strong>practise</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So the verb <strong>practise </strong> is <strong>p-r-a-c-t-i-S-e</strong>. It ends in <strong>s-e</strong> not <strong>c-e. </strong>That’s a very common mistake because the noun<strong> practice </strong>is spelt with <strong>i-c-e </strong>at the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And finally we heard<strong> experience. </strong>Now is that<strong> e-n-c-e </strong>or<strong> a-n-c-e </strong>at the end?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Experience</strong> ends in <strong>e-n-c-e</strong>. Whereas <strong>performance</strong> ends in <strong>a-n-c-e</strong>. And yet again  there’s no rule for these spellings. You just have to check them and learn them.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>            </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it’s quiz time! Number one. My sister’s new baby’s very loveable. But how do you spell <strong>loveable</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It’s<strong> l-o-v-e-a-b-l-e.  </strong>Not forgetting the <strong>e</strong> in the middle.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You’re right!  Now question two: The word <strong>ancient</strong> – meaning very old - does not follow the usual rule. Can you spell it?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ancient is <strong>a-n-c-i-e-n-t</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly, and question three: How many<strong> l</strong>s are there in <strong>quarrelling</strong>, meaning arguing?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The answer’s two<strong> l</strong>s<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Double <strong>l</strong>, that’s correct, well done.  And well done if you got those right at home. There’s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>\n<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p> </div>",

It’s a good rule but there are spelt <strong>ei</strong> after other letters.</p>\n<p><strong>foreign, height, leisure, neighbour, weird</strong></p>\n<p>In British English, with verbs that end in a vowel before <strong>l</strong> or <strong>r</strong>, we double the final consonants when we make them into past or continuous forms.</p>\n<p><strong>travel – travelled, travelling.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>prefer – preferred, preferring</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is only one <strong>l</strong> at the end of adjectives ending in -<strong>ful</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>grateful, hopeful, skilful</strong></p>\n<p>Words that begin with an<strong> s, </strong>may have a silent<strong> c </strong>after the<strong> s.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>scenery, science, scissors</strong></p>\n<p>The verb<strong> practise</strong>, is spelt<strong> -ise </strong>in British English. The noun is spelt<strong> -ice.</strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of words that end in<strong> -ence </strong>or<strong> -ance</strong>, but they are pronounced exactly the same. There is no rule for learning these.</p>\n<p>experi<strong>ence</strong>, sequ<strong>ence</strong>,  accept<strong>ance</strong>, bal<strong>ance</strong></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Some simple spelling rules</h3>\n<p>People often say that English spelling is really irregular and complicated. That's not entirely true as there is in fact a lot of consistency in English spelling. Here are a few of the more regular spelling guidelines. Please note that these are guidelines only and you may still come across exceptions.</p>\n<h3><strong>Words ending in the sound </strong>/ʤ/</h3>\n<p>There are no English words that end in the letter <strong>j</strong>. If a word has this sound at the end the spelling will be <strong>ge</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rage, cage, huge, wedge</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the word contains a short vowel sound, the <strong>ge </strong>usually has a silent <strong>d </strong>in front.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>hedge, bridge, wedge</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Words ending in the sound /v/</h3>\n<p>There are no English words that end in the letter <strong>v</strong> (except some acronyms, abbreviations or names). There will usually be an <strong>e </strong>after the <strong>v</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>gave, save, have, shove</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>C or K</h3>\n<p>If the sound <strong>/k/</strong> is followed by the vowel sounds <strong>/æ/</strong>, <strong>/ɒ/</strong> or <strong>/ʌ/</strong>, the spelling of the <strong>/k/</strong> sound will be <strong>c</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>cat, cot, cut</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>If <strong>/k/</strong> is followed by <strong>/i/</strong> or <strong>/e/</strong>, then the spelling of the<strong> /</strong><strong>k/ </strong>sound will be <strong>k</strong>.</br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>kiss, kept</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Words ending in the sound<strong> /k/ </strong>are spelt <strong>-ke </strong>if the sound before the /k/ is a long vowel sound.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>cake, joke, strike</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>If the vowel sound is short and immediately before the <strong>/k/</strong> sound the spelling will be <strong>ck</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>sick, track, lock, luck<br/><br/></strong>(Note the word <strong>trek</strong> is an exception to this rule)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the word has more than one syllable and the last sound is <strong>/k/</strong>, the spelling will be <strong>c</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>panic, picnic, traffic</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Note the word <strong>attack</strong> is an exception to this rule)</p>\n<p>When making a gerund or present participle of words that end in <strong>c</strong>, add <strong>k </strong>before adding <strong>ing</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>panicking, picnicking, trafficking</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the middle of a word if there is a <strong>/k/</strong> sound, the spelling will be <strong>c</strong> after a vowel sound and <strong>k </strong>after a consonant sound.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>locate, correct, dictation<br/>basket, blanket, ankle</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Use these rules to decide if the words in the quiz are spelt correctly or not.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Do you know 'you're' from 'your', 'their' from 'there' and 'it's' from 'its'? These words are called homophones and you can find out more about them in the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Same sound, different spelling</h3>\n<p>English has quite a few words that sound the same, but which have different spellings and meanings.</p>\n<p>It's / its</p>\n<p>Their / there / they're</p>\n<p>Your / you're</p>\n<p><em><strong>It's</strong> over <strong>there</strong>.<br/></em><em><strong>Their</strong> cat had left <strong>its</strong> toys in the washing machine.<br/><strong>You're</strong> right, <strong>your</strong> train doesn't leave until 11.00.</em></p>\n<p>These words are called <strong>homophones</strong>. Here are a few more examples:</p>\n<p>allowed / aloud</p>\n<p>break / brake</p>\n<p>cell / sell</p>\n<p>hear / here</p>\n<p>no / know</p>\n<p>right / write</p>\n<p>sea / see</p>\n<p>steel / steal</p>\n<p>weight / wait</p>\n<p>which / witch</p>\n<p>whole / hole</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>A tip for remembering which spelling is which</h3>\n<p>Look at the letters that are different, can you think of a connection between the meaning of the word and the different letter? For example:</p>\n<p><strong>Cell</strong> and <strong>sell</strong>: <strong>S</strong>ell is something that happens in a <strong>s</strong>hop. Shop begins with <strong>S</strong>, that can help you remember that <strong>sell </strong>begins with <strong>s.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hear </strong>and <strong>here</strong>: <strong>Hear </strong>is what you do with your <strong>ear</strong>s. That can help you remember that when you mean <strong>hear </strong>with your <strong>ears </strong>the spelling is <strong>h - e - a - r</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Allowed</strong> and <strong>aloud</strong>: Something that is aloud, makes a s<strong>ou</strong>nd. So use that to help you remember that the word <strong>aloud</strong> has <strong>ou </strong>in, just like <strong>sound</strong>.</p>\n<p>Can you think of other examples to help you remember the <strong>homophones</strong> in the list? </p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Here's a quiz to help you practise some of the homophones in the list.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>How did you do? Don't worry if you made a few mistakes. It takes time to get good at spelling. In the next session we leave the topic of spelling and move on to look at some phrasal verbs. Now, that is something to look forward to, isn't it?</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme we’re talking about multi-word verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Yes, these are verbs that are <strong>made up </strong>of more than one word. There is a main verb followed by one or two particles, which might be adverbs or prepositions.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Multi-word verbs are incredibly important. They're used all the time in spoken English and often in written English. So if you want to have a good understanding of English and want to be able to express yourself naturally, it’s a good idea to know your multi-word verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>There are different types of multi-word verbs and today we’re looking at four types of prepositional verbs and phrasal verbs. And to keep things simpler we’ll refer to them all as phrasal verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let’s start with a clip from Dave. And Dave is talking about his holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And listen for the answer to this question: Why did Dave have to stay in bed?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dave<br/></strong>It wasn’t the holiday I was expecting. On the first day, I <strong>picked up</strong> a nasty bug. I think I <strong>picked it up</strong> from something I ate. Anyway, I had to stay in bed. It took me a few days to <strong>get over</strong> that. Then my girlfriend and I <strong>split up</strong>. Well, we hadn’t been <strong>getting along</strong> well for some time.  I guess we just couldn’t <strong>put up with</strong> each other for any longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, that was Dave using a lot of phrasal verbs. Now the question was: Why did Dave have to stay in bed, Callum?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And the answer is: Because he <strong>picked up</strong> a nasty bug.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>picked up</strong> is a phrasal verb that means <strong>caught </strong>here. He picked up a nasty bug: he caught an unpleasant illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>To <strong>pick up</strong> is an example of a type one phrasal verb. These phrasal verbs are transitive which means they always have an object. Without an object it doesn’t make sense so there has to be <strong>something</strong> that is <strong>picked up</strong>. In this example, the object of <strong>picked up</strong> is <strong>a nasty bug</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And with type 1 phrasal verbs, you can put the object after the particle or between the verb and the particle. </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So you can say <strong>I picked up a nasty bug</strong> or <strong>I picked a nasty bug up</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But if you use an object pronoun like <strong>it</strong>, <strong>him, </strong>or<strong> her, </strong>it <strong>must</strong> go between the verb and the particle.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>As we heard Dave say about the bug, he <strong>picked it up</strong> from something he ate. Not he picked up it.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Good. Now listen for another phrasal verb in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1         <br/></strong>It took me a few days to <strong>get over</strong> that.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now <strong>get over</strong> is our second type of phrasal verb. To get over something means to feel better after an illness or an upsetting event.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It’s transitive too, so it always has an object but unlike type 1 phrasal verbs the object or the object pronoun must come after the particle.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. You can’t separate the verb and the particle. Unlike Dave and his girlfriend! What phrasal verb does he use for that?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong>Then my girlfriend and I <strong>split up</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. It’s not very nice to <strong>split up</strong> on holiday, is it? And <strong>split up</strong> is a type three phrasal verb. What do we need to know about type threes, Callum?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Well, they’re intransitive. That means that they don’t have an object and you can’t split the two parts of the phrasal verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Dave used another type three. Listen again.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong>Well, we hadn’t been <strong>getting along</strong> well for some time.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong><strong>Getting along</strong> is also intransitive. There’s no object. And what does it mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If two people <strong>get along</strong> it means that they like each other and have a good relationship with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Next clip please.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 4<br/></strong>I guess we just couldn’t <strong>put up with</strong> each other for any longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And there’s our fourth type of phrasal verb. There are three parts to it. There’s <strong>put</strong> followed by the particles <strong>up</strong> and <strong>with</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And there’s an object, <strong>each other</strong>. Like type two phrasal verbs the object must always come after the particles.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And finally some phrasal verbs are both type 3 and type 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Yes. Do you remember that Dave and his girlfriend hadn’t been <strong>getting along</strong>? Well, you could also say that they hadn’t been <strong>getting along with</strong> each other. We can sometimes extend the type three phrasal verbs to become type four. So Catherine, how do you know which type a phrasal verb is?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, if you see it or hear it being used, you can usually work it out but also a good dictionary will tell you whether it’s transitive or not. So I recommend whenever you note a new phrasal verb you also write down some examples and what type it is.</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong>           </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It’s quiz time! Number one: right or wrong? When Dave got ill, it took him a few days to get it over.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that’s wrong. It should have been <strong>get over it</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Excellent! Number two: finish the sentence. Dave’s off work. a) He picked up a cold. b) He picked a cold up. c) both a) and b) are possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer’s c), both a) and b) are possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Number three: Which is correct? a) Dave and I get along well. b) I get along well Dave. c) I get Dave along well.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer's a) Dave and I get along well.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It is! And brilliant, well done  if you got them all right.  </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There’s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What is a multi-word verb?</h3>\n<p>A multi-word verb is a verb that has more than one word. We usually think of them as a main verb followed by one or two particles. The particle could be <strong>an adverb</strong> or <strong>a preposition</strong>.</p>\n<p>I<em> never <strong>messed around</strong> at school, I was a good student.<br/></em>(to mess around = to behave badly)<br/><em><br/>My car's <strong>broken down</strong> twice this month. I think it's time <strong>to</strong> <strong>splash out on</strong> a new one.</em><br/>(to break down = to stop working / to splash out on something = to spend a lot of money on something)<em><br/><br/>I'm busy now. Can you <strong>call</strong> me <strong>back</strong> later?</em><br/>(to call someone back = to telephone someone again)<em><br/><br/>Alright, I <strong>give in</strong>, you can have a party. Now stop <strong>going on about</strong> it.<br/></em>(to give in = to agree to do something after a long time without agreement / to go on about something = to talk about a particular subject repeatedly)</p>\n<p>Multi-word verbs with prepositions are known as <strong>prepositional verbs</strong>. Multi-word verbs with adverbs are known as <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>. The term <strong>phrasal verbs </strong>is often used to refer to all multi-word verbs.</p>\n<h3>What do they mean?</h3>\n<p>The meaning of some multi-word verbs is easy to understand - or <strong>work out</strong> - as they are quite literal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sit down</strong>, please.</em><br/><em>Why don't we <strong>give away</strong> our old clothes to charity?</em><br/><em>Don't try <strong>to</strong> <strong>get on</strong> the train if it's already moving.</em><br/><br/>Other multi-word verbs are more metaphorical and idiomatic so it can be difficult <strong>to</strong> <strong>work out </strong>their meaning.</p>\n<p><em>Can you please stop <strong>showing up </strong>your brother.</em><br/>(to show someone up = to embarrass someone by pointing out things they are not good at or are doing wrong)<br/><em>I wasn't expecting him to <strong>show up</strong>.</em><br/>(to show up = to arrive at a place or event)</p>\n<h3>Do you need to learn them?</h3>\n<p>Oh yes! multi-word verbs are very very common in everyday spoken English and in writing. Understanding them will really help you with your English comprehension.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Same verb, different meaning</h3>\n<p>Some multi-word verbs have different meanings. These examples are all connected with verb <strong>to</strong> <strong>take off</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>He's very good at <strong>taking</strong> people <strong>off</strong>. </em><br/>(to take someone off = to impersonate, mimic, copy the way someone speaks)<br/><br/><em>Our flight finally <strong>took off</strong> after a two-hour delay.</em><br/>(to take off = to leave the ground) </p>\n<p><em>When he came in he <strong>took</strong> his jacket <strong>off</strong>.</em><br/>(to take something off = to remove an item of clothing)</p>\n<p><em>I never thought social media would <strong>take off</strong>. I guess I couldn't have been more wrong.</em><br/>(to take off = to become successful and popular)</p>\n<p><em>He wasn't playing well so the manager <strong>took</strong> him <strong>off</strong> after 30 minutes.</em><br/>(to take someone off = to substitute a player)</p>\n<p><em>Crumbs! Is that the time? I've got <strong>to take off</strong>.</em><br/>(to take off = to leave suddenly)</p>\n<p><em>I'm not feeling very well, I think I'll have <strong>to take</strong> the day <strong>off</strong>.</em><br/>(to take a period of time off = to not go to work for a period of time)</p>\n<h3>The grammar of multi-word verbs</h3>\n<p>There are <strong>four</strong> types of multi-word verbs. Each type has different rules which tell you if they have an object and where you can put the object.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 1</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>transitive: they must have a direct object</li>\n<li>the object can come after the particle or between the verb and particle<br/><em>He took off <strong>his jacket</strong>.</em><br/><em>He took <strong>his jacket</strong> off.</em></li>\n<li>if you use a pronoun instead of the object it <strong>must </strong>come between the verb and particle.<br/><em>He took <strong>it</strong> off.</em><br/><strong>NOT:</strong> <em>He took off <strong>it</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some other Type 1 verbs from this page.</p>\n<p>to <strong>call</strong> someone <strong>back<br/></strong>to <strong>give</strong> something <strong>away<br/></strong>to<strong> show </strong>someone<strong> up<br/></strong>to<strong> take </strong>something <strong>off</strong><br/>to<strong> take </strong>someone<strong> off<br/></strong>to <strong>take </strong>a period of time <strong>off</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Type 2</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>transitive: they have a direct object</li>\n<li>the object <strong>must</strong> come after the particle<br/><em>Don't try to get on <strong>the train</strong> if it's already moving.<br/></em><strong>NOT:</strong><em> Don't try to get <strong>the</strong> <strong>train </strong>on if it's already moving.</em></li>\n<li>if you use a pronoun instead of the object it <strong>must not</strong> come between the verb and particle.<br/><em>Don't try to get on <strong>it</strong> if it's already moving.<br/></em><strong>NOT:</strong> <em>Don't try to get <strong>it</strong> on if it's already moving.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's a type 2 verb from this page.<em><br/></em></p>\n<p>To <strong>get on</strong> something</p>\n<p><strong>Type 3</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>intransitive: they don't have an object</li>\n<li>you <strong>can't</strong> split the verb from the particle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some Type 3 verbs from this page.</p>\n<p>to <strong>mess around</strong><br/>to <strong>break down</strong><br/>to <strong>give in<br/></strong>to <strong>show up<br/></strong>to <strong>take off</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br/>Type 4</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>transitive: they have a direct object</li>\n<li>they have <strong>two particles</strong> (an adverb followed by a preposition)</li>\n<li>You <strong>must</strong> put the object or pronoun after both particles.<br/><em>Stop going on about <strong>it</strong></em>.<br/><strong>NOT: </strong><em>Stop going on <strong>it</strong> about.</em><br/><strong>NOT:</strong> <em>Stop going <strong>it</strong> on about.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some Type 4 verbs from this page.</p>\n<p>to <strong>splash out on</strong> something.<br/>to <strong>go on about </strong>something.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>The quiz has multi-word verbs from this page. Choose the best answer to complete each sentence. </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now we've <strong>gone over</strong> the rules, it's time for some tips on how to study and learn multi-word verbs. There's also another quiz to help you practise some more.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Tip 1</h3>\n<p>It's important to know what type a phrasal verb is. When you hear or see it being used you can often <strong>work it out.</strong></p>\n<p>Look at the example from the sentence above. What type of phrasal verb is it?</p>\n<p><em>You can often <strong>work it out</strong>. </em></p>\n<p>You can see that the pronoun <strong>it</strong> has split the verb and particle. This means it must be a <strong>Type 1 </strong>phrasal verb.</p>\n<h3>Tip 2</h3>\n<p>The way you <strong>note down</strong> multi-word verbs can help you remember what type they are. Can you see any patterns?</p>\n<p><strong>Type 1</strong></p>\n<p><em>to take something off</em><br><em>to call someone back</em></br></p>\n<p>The object pronouns <em>someone/something</em> are splitting the verb. This will always show it's a <strong>type 1</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 2</strong></p>\n<p><em>to get on something</em><br/><em>to work on something</em><br/><br/>The object pronoun <em>something </em>comes after the verb and particle. This tells you it's a <strong>type 2.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Type 3</strong></p>\n<p><em>to mess around<br/>to give in<br/></em></p>\n<p>Note that there are no pronouns because <strong>type 3</strong> verbs are intransitive, they don't have objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 4</strong></p>\n<p><em>to splash out on something</em><br/><em>to go on about something</em></p>\n<p>These are easy to identify as type 4 because they have <strong>two particles</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Tip 3</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you come across a new multi-word verb, note it down and be sure to include an example and what type it is.</p>\n<p>To send something back = to return something that's been delivered to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 1<br/></strong>I had to <strong>send back the shoes</strong>, they were the wrong size.<br/>I had to <strong>send them back</strong>, they were the wrong size.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Can you <strong>work out</strong> what type the phrasal verbs are in the quiz?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>How did you <strong>get on? </strong>(<strong>To get on</strong> is a type 3 by the way). Hope you've <strong>picked up</strong> (type 1) some useful tips and an understanding of the grammar of multi-word verbs.

With the help of his elderly parents, this forger from Bolton, northwest England, made and sold fake <strong>artefacts</strong> worth millions of pounds. He did it for 17 years before the police caught up with the family. How did they manage to pull this off for so long? We will paint a picture of their career for you.  </span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p><span><span>Read this article quite quickly and then answer this question: </span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Question</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>What might have been the Bolton forger's real <strong>motivation </strong>for selling fake artefacts? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Getting forgery down to a fine art</h3>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 1<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Shaun Greenhalgh left school with no qualifications, but he <strong>tried his hand at</strong> a wide range of crafts – from water colour painting to sculpture. His own pieces were not admired, so he started to copy from others, says detective Ian Lawson from Scotland Yard's Art and Antiques Unit. Shaun worked in the family's garden shed and ended up creating a <strong>cottage industry</strong>. The plan was to approach art galleries and museums and make them think the items were <strong>family heirlooms</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 2<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>If the son had a talent for art, the father – George Greenhalgh – had the<strong> gift of the gab</strong> and approached potential buyers with detailed stories about how he had found artworks which were lost for generations. In 2003, he sold a 50cm statue called Amarna Princess to Bolton Museum, saying that his own grandfather had bought it at an <strong>auction </strong>in 1892 at an aristocrat’s home. The old original auction catalogue that the forgers had bought earlier backed the claim up. It mentioned \"Egyptian figures\". This could be one of these, couldn't it?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 3<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>After talking to art experts, the museum paid more than £400,000 for the statue, which was supposed to represent one of the daughters of the <strong>Pharaoh </strong>Akhenaten. The successful <strong>con </strong>made the forgers grow bolder. They approached one of the most prestigious art institutions in the world: the British Museum. The pieces on offer were supposed to be three Assyrian <strong>reliefs</strong> of soldiers and horses with some inscriptions from 600 BC. One expert spotted a mistake in the writing and examined the items more carefully. The expert was suspicious and the museum tipped off the police. Shaun Greenhalgh might have been a good forger, but <strong>cuneiform</strong> spelling was not his <strong>forte</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 4<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>After 18 months of investigations in which more fakes were uncovered, <strong>the Old Bill</strong> knocked at the family's door. They were surprised by the Greenhalgh's humble home. Where were the <strong>riches</strong> of successful criminals? The police concluded that Shaun was motivated by <strong>resentment</strong> of the lack of appreciation of his own artistic talent, rather than by money. In 2007, the elderly couple were given a 12-month <strong>suspended sentence</strong> and their son was jailed for four and a half years - and they were ordered to pay back the money to the art institutions they had fooled.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 5<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>And what is Shaun Greenhalgh doing today, you might ask? Has he learnt his lesson: that copying other people's work is not a good idea? No, he hasn't. The difference is that this time he admits his forgeries are made by himself. And his old pieces have even made it into the Victoria and Albert Museum in London – the 2010 exhibition they appeared in was called The Art of Crime. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Part 6<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>How did he manage to fool so many experts? Irvin Finkel from the British Museum has an explanation: \"The clever thing about these people is they produced things that in a way we were looking for already. So when we saw it we wanted to embrace this long-lost treasure. They were very clever and they nearly fooled us.\" </span></span><span><span>Shaun's case also helped the museums to wise up. A museum security group to share information and concerns was set up to avoid successful scams.</span></span></p>\n<h3>Answer to the first question:</h3>\n<p><span><span>The police concluded that money might not have been Shaun Greenhalgh's main motivation to make and sell forgeries. He might have done it because he resented the art market - they didn't appreciate his talent.</span></span></p>\n<h3>To do<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>This article contains a number of phrasal verbs, including:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>catch up with </span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>pull off</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>end up</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>back up</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>tip off</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>wise up to</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>set up</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span>Working out the meaning of new words from their context is a very important skill.  Find the phrasal verbs in this list in the article, read around them carefully and then answer the questions.

That's what I said when I had to register at my place of rest – but the man on reception gave me a very strange look.</p>\n<p>How did my journey terminate in this magnificent city I hear you ask? Well Emperor Caesar said I should escape to take my rest as I had been working so hard. So I chose to come here – Londinium – one of the northern outposts of the Roman Empire.</p>\n<p>But it isn't what I had expected – no chariots – instead I have to explore the city on these strange red double-decker buses. And for entertainment, people go to a theatre to see something called a 'musical' not slaves being eaten by lions, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>I shall go to observe one of these 'musicals' but not before I have absorbed the atmosphere of the city from a strange contraption called The London Eye. But how do I get there? The nice man at the hotel gave me a 'Tube map' but I can't seem to decipher it.</p>\n<p>I shall use my feet to walk there – actually not walk but march – and I will enquire for directions. Maybe these people will be able to suggest which musical I go to see tonight – I do hope there's one that involves slaves being cut to pieces.</p>\n<p>But please detain yourself. If I am to go to the theatre tonight I need to attire myself smartly - not wear this scruffy old toga. I only have a few pieces of gold and Londinium isn't cheap so I will need to compare prices at a number of shops – and if I have a few nuggets left I might buy Caesar an 'I 'heart' Londinium' T-shirt. He'll love that!</p>\n<p>Oh but how am I going to do all of this today? I suppose I've always got tomorrow – after all Rome – I mean Londinium wasn't built in a day!</p> </div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me Catherine. In this programme we’re talking about interjections. Interjections are words that we use to express an emotion or feeling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>For example <strong>Oh!</strong> expresses surprise and <strong>Hooray!</strong> expresses pleasure when something good happens. We’ll give you plenty of other examples.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We’ll have a quiz; and we’ll finish with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Here are Peter and Kylie. They’re at home in their kitchen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And while you listen, think about this question: What emotion does Peter express by the word <strong>Phew!</strong> at the end of this conversation?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>INSERT </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Peter and Kylie</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Peter:<strong> Ow!<br/></strong>Kylie: What’s wrong?<br/>Peter: I’ve just cut my finger.<br/>Kylie:<strong> Oh!</strong> Quick, where’s the First Aid kit?<br/>Peter: It’s in that drawer.<br/>Kylie: Got it. <strong>Ugh</strong>! There’s blood everywhere. <strong>Oh no!</strong> It’s on my T-shirt now. Let me see your finger.<br/>Peter: There you go.<br/>Kylie: There, got the plaster on it, <strong>hooray</strong>! <br/>Peter:<strong> Phew</strong>! Thanks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>STING</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So that was Peter and Kylie. And we asked: What emotion does Peter express by the word <strong>Phew</strong>! at the end of the conversation?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is that he expresses relief. Peter feels relieved that Kylie has got the plaster on his finger.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>He does. People use interjections a lot in everyday speech. It’s interesting that one little word like <strong>Phew!</strong> can express so much, isn’t it?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It is. And that’s why it’s important to learn to use interjections when your speaking, to make your English sound more natural and fluent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Now, interjections usually come at the beginning of what we are saying, but they can sometimes come at the end. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So Peter says <strong>Phew! Thanks</strong>, but he could have said <strong>Thanks. Phew!</strong> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>But, whichever way he says it, the interjection stands alone. There are no words to connect it to what comes after or before it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That’s right, and if you’re writing a conversation with interjections, they’re usually followed by an exclamation mark.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Because the exclamation mark emphasises the strength of the emotion and increases the interest for the reader. <strong>Phew!</strong> with an exclamation mark looks more dramatic than <strong>Phew.</strong> with a full stop.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It does. That’s interesting, isn’t it? Let’s have our first clip.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Peter:<strong> Ow!<br/></strong>Kylie: What’s wrong?<br/>Peter: I’ve just cut my finger.<br/>Kylie:<strong> Oh!</strong> Quick, where’s the First Aid kit?<br/>Peter: It’s in that drawer.<br/>Kylie: Got it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. So what does Peter express with <strong>Ow!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong><strong>Ow!</strong> expresses sudden pain. We can say <strong>Ouch!</strong> too. They mean the same.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the second interjection was <strong>Oh!</strong> Kylie uses it to show surprise and alarm that Peter has cut his finger. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Yes. Now if you wanted to describe the scene in writing you would have to say: <strong>Peter shouted in sudden pain</strong>, instead of using<strong> Ow! </strong>Or <strong>Peter’s voice expressed relief</strong>, instead of using<strong> Phew!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That’s right. Interjections are very useful when speaking, but they’re not often used in written English, except for writing dialogues like the one between Peter and Kylie. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>OK. Let’s have our second clip.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kylie: <strong>Ugh</strong>! There’s blood everywhere. <strong>Oh no!</strong> It’s on my T-shirt now. Let me see your finger.<br/>Peter: There you go.<br/>Kylie: There, got the plaster on it, <strong>hooray</strong>! <br/>Peter:<strong> Phew</strong>! Thanks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Kylie uses three interjections there! No we don’t usually use so many together but the situation is quite dramatic, so it’s natural to use them together there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>There was <strong>Ugh!</strong>, which expresses disgust at the blood everywhere.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And there was <strong>Oh no!</strong> which expresses shock. Kylie was a bit shocked that the blood was on her T-shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And finally <strong>Hooray! </strong>That expresses pleasure or delight that something good has happened. Kylie was very pleased that she’d managed to get the plaster on Peter’s finger.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Other common interjections are <strong>Wow! </strong>for admiration, <strong>Oops!</strong> for when you make a mistake and <strong>Yippee!</strong> for excitement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>IDENT</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It’s time now for our quiz! Listen to each sentence, then choose the correct interjection to go before each one. Number one: There’s a dead snake in the road. Is it a) Ouch! Or b) Ugh!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It’s b) Ugh! for disgust</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It is! Number two:  What a beautiful building. Is it a) Wow! Or b) Hooray!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It’s a) Wow! for admiration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum.<br/></strong>Correct! Number three: Amy’s passed her driving test. Is it a) Oops! Or b) Phew!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It’s b) Phew! for relief</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Excellent! That’s the end of the quiz and congratulations if you got them all right.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Before we go, here’s today’s top tip.  When you’re speaking everyday English, you don’t always need to use high-level vocabulary to express your meaning. It’s more important to be clear and sometimes simple words like interjections express your meaning much more clearly than a sentence with advanced vocabulary in it. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Callum<br/></strong>There’s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.

They are not often used in written English except in written conversations.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They usually come at the beginning of what we’re saying and they are often followed by an exclamation mark. The exclamation mark increases the strength of the emotion.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Oh!</strong> What a lovely surprise.  (surprise)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hooray!</strong> It’s the summer holidays. (pleasure)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Ouch! / Ow!</strong> I just stepped on a pin.  (pain)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Ugh!</strong> I hate mice.

There are quite a few so here are some more.</p>\n<p>Here's a conversation between a mother and her teenage son. See if you can work out the meaning of the interjections. </p>\n<p>Mum: Tom?</p>\n<p>Tom: <strong>Mhm!</strong></p>\n<p>Mum: Do you want broccoli with your tea?</p>\n<p>Tom: <strong>Yuck!</strong></p>\n<p>Mum: How about peas?</p>\n<p>Tom: <strong>Eww!</strong></p>\n<p>Mum: What about some carrots?</p>\n<p>Tom: <strong>Meh!</strong></p>\n<p>Mum: Don't you want any vegetables?</p>\n<p>Tom: <strong>Duh!</strong></p>\n<p>Mum: <strong>Humph!</strong></p>\n<p>Tom: <strong>Whatever!</strong> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Meanings</strong></p>\n<p>Do you think you understood the meanings? Here are the definitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Mhm!</strong> = Yes, expresses acknowledgement</p>\n<p><strong>Yuck! </strong>= Expresses disgust or strong dislike</p>\n<p><strong>Eww! = </strong>Another interjection for expressing disgust or dislike</p>\n<p><strong>Meh! </strong>= Expresses indifference or means that something is not terrible but is not very good</p>\n<p><strong>Duh! </strong>= Expresses annoyance about something that should have been obvious, commenting that the other speaker is being stupid.</p>\n<p><strong>Humph! </strong>= An expression of disatisfaction or annoyance.</p>\n<p><strong>Whatever! = </strong>A dismissive, sometimes rude comment showing that the speaker doesn't care about what the other person says.</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>In the quiz choose whether the statements about this conversation are true or false.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p><strong>Great! </strong>You've finished the quiz. <strong>Hooray! </strong>Now for some more interjections and another quiz, try the next activity.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Said with feeling</h3>\n<p>Interjections are an emotional response to a situation. As we've seen in the first activities they can express pain, surprise, anger, boredom, irritation and a whole range of other emotions.</p>\n<p>When we say them, there is normally some body language that goes with them for example a scrunched up face with <strong>yuck! </strong>or a shrug of the shoulders with <strong>meh!</strong></p>\n<p>Tone of voice is also very important. Compare these two sentences.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hey!</strong> Look where you're going? You nearly crashed into me. </em>(Anger and surprise)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hey!</strong> Look at that puppy. So cute. </em>(Getting someone's attention)</p>\n<p>The same word would need to be said in different ways in order to match the emotion.</p>\n<p>As interjections are often an instinctive response to something. We don't really have time to think about them, they just come out.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Not just your pain</h3>\n<p>You probably remember that <strong>ouch! </strong>is used for when we hurt ourselves. We can also use it when seeing or hearing about someone else's pain. That pain could be real or metaphorical.</p>\n<p><em>\"I fell off my bike and broke my arm.\"<br>\"<strong>Ouch!</strong>\"</br></em></p>\n<p><em>\"How much was the fine?\"<br/>\"£1000\"<br/>\"<strong>Ouch!</strong>\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"She told me I was the worst boyfriend she'd ever had.\"<br/>\"<strong>Ouch!</strong> That's gotta hurt.\"</em> </p>\n<h3>Some more interjections</h3>\n<p><strong>Ooh! = </strong>surprise, excitement or pleasure<br/><em><strong>Ooh!</strong> Look, a rainbow.</em><br/><em><strong>Ooh! </strong>My favourite film is on TV tonight. Can we watch it? </em></p>\n<p><strong>Mmm! = </strong>pleasure<br/><em><strong>Mmm!</strong> This cake is yummy, did you make it?<br/><strong>Mmm!</strong> </em><em>This massage is great</em></p>\n<p><strong>Oi! = </strong>Anger and surprise<em><br/><strong>Oi! </strong>You just knocked over my drink.<br/><strong>Oi!</strong> Look where you're going!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Aha!</strong> = sudden understanding with a feeling of success<br/><em><strong>Aha!</strong> I remember where I put my keys.<br/></em><em><strong>Aha! </strong>I knew this was the right way.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Whoa! = </strong>response to something unexpected or encouragement to slow down<br/><em><strong>Whoa! </strong></em><em>Did you see that? The power went off and came back on again, that can't be good.</em><br/><em><strong>Whoa! </strong></em><em>Slow down, tell me what happened.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In this session we've shown you a lot of interjections. Do you think you can choose the right one? Try the quiz to find out.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p><strong>Phew!</strong> That's the end of this section about interjections.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>             <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</br></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>           <br/>And me, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>           <br/>Today’s programme is about a couple of ways of talking about the future. The <strong>future continuous</strong> verb form and <strong>be</strong> plus the infinitive.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>you’re to listen</strong> carefully…</p>\n<p><strong>Callum</strong>       <br/>Good example!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Thank you. Let’s start with the future continuous. Here’s an example. This time next week, I’ll be sitting on a beach in Mallorca.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Lucky you! So, <strong>I’ll be sitting</strong>, in the future continuous, is an event that will be happening at a particular time in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And I’ve already planned it. I used the time phrase <strong>this time next week</strong>. We can use other time phrases like …<strong>next year</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Or <strong>tonight</strong>, for example.We can also use the future continuous to say how long we’ll be doing something. So Catherine how long will you be staying in Mallorca?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>I’ll be staying in Palma <strong>for one week </strong>before travelling around the island.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So Catherine used the future continuous to say she plans to stay in Palma for <strong>a week.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>That’s right. Now w  e can also use the future continuous to say we’ll be doing something while something else is happening… So, Callum, <strong>while you’re working </strong>at the BBC <strong>I’ll be</strong> <strong>sipping</strong> my cocktails by the hotel pool!</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Yes, notice that we usually use the present continuous in the time phrase after <strong>while</strong>… Catherine said <strong>while I’m working.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>We could use <strong>when </strong>instead of while, and follow it with the present simple.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example. </p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>A taxi will be waiting when you arrive. </p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Today we’re looking at the future continuous to talk about future plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>But we use it for other things as well. For example, we can use the future continuous to make predictions. Here’s an example.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Those clouds look very dark. It’ll be raining soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Rob knows it’ll be raining soon because the sky is very dark.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>We can also use the future continuous to say what we imagine to be true at the moment. Listen to this example.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob <br/></strong>You can’t ring Abdul now! It’s two o’clock in the morning in Dubai. <strong>He’ll be sleeping</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We don’t know for certain that Abdul is sleeping, but it’s likely. </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Sometimes we use the future continuous in a question when we want to be polite. Here’s an example</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> Will you be staying </strong>for dinner?</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>We form the future continuous with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> won’t </strong>plus <strong>be </strong>and the <strong>–ing form</strong> of the main verb. Here are some examples :</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>I’ll be sitting by the pool.<br/>I won’t be taking any work with me.<br/>They’ll be arriving after midnight.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Notice that we usually use contracted forms, so I<strong>’ll</strong> …and <strong>won’t</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>For questions it’s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won’t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>be</strong> plus the <strong>–ing</strong> form of the verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Why will they be arriving so late tonight?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>So that’s the future continuous. Now let’s look at <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>the infinitive</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>We sometimes use this to tell someone what they must or mustn’t do. Here are some examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Students are to enter the hall from the back.<br/>You’re not to go out without telling me!</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>We often find this structure in more formal English, for example to describe official arrangements. </p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to visit Singapore next month.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Or in media reports to say what will almost certainly happen. We form this structure with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>be </strong>plus the<strong> infinitive with to. </strong>Listen to this example.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>A man is to appear in court later today charged with murder.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>For the negative it’s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>not</strong> plus the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>You are not to go to bed late tonight!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And remember, we often use short forms like: <strong>You’re not </strong>and <strong>He isn’t…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We're talking about the <strong>future continuous</strong> tense and <strong>be plus the infinitive</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So, to recap, we use the future continuous to describe plans at a particular time in the future or for how long we’ll be doing something. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>We also use it for predictions…</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And for polite enquiries and to say what we assume is happening.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We use <strong>be </strong>plus<strong> the infinitive </strong>for future events which involve instruction or necessity.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And for official arrangements or reports saying what will almost certainly happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Time for our quiz. Which is correct a or b. Ready?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Number one. a) I work in New York next summer or b) I’ll be working in New York next summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> It’s b). </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Correct. Number 2. a) Students are not to bring their cars to school. b) Students are not bring their cars to school.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It’s a).</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>That’s right. Finally, number three. a) I’ll be working hard while you relaxing in the sun. b) I’ll be working hard while you’re relaxing in the sun.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> It’s b.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Correct and that’s the end of the programme.

You <strong>are to pay</strong> close attention!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>In the news</h3>\n<p>Look at these headlines and stories from the BBC News website. They all share a particular grammar form, which is highlighted in <strong>bold</strong>. What can you learn about the form and how to make it from these examples? Can you answer these questions?</p>\n<p>Are all the sentences about something in the past, something in the present or something in the future?<br>How do you make this form?<br/>Why is the form of the last example different?</br></p>\n<p>REM announce they<strong> are to split</strong>.

In this case the form is:</p>\n<p><strong>subject + be + to be + infinitive with to</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Headlines</strong></h3>\n<p>This form is often in written news headlines. In the headlines it is very common to <strong>leave out</strong> the verb <strong>to be.</strong></p>\n<p>REM <strong>to split</strong><br/>One Direction <strong>to take break<br/></strong>Prince of Wales <strong>to visit</strong> the Republic of Ireland<br/>Human Rights lessons <strong>to be offered</strong> to schools (passive)</p>\n<h3>Giving orders</h3>\n<p>The <strong>be + infinitive with to </strong>form is also used to give orders.</p>\n<p>No one <strong>is to leave</strong> the building.<br/>Phones <strong>are not to be taken</strong> into the exam.<br/>Students <strong>are to wear</strong> uniforms at all times.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>About to</h3>\n<p>The <strong>be + infinitve with to</strong> form is used with <strong>about</strong> to say that something is going to happen in the near future.</p>\n<p><em>You'd better run, the bus <strong>is about to leave</strong>.</em><br/><em>Careful, you'<strong>re</strong> <strong>about to lose</strong> your wallet, it's coming out of your pocket.</em><br/><em>They'<strong>re</strong> <strong>about to call</strong> our flight, we should go to the gate.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In this session we've looked at different uses of two future forms.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Brazilians are friendly and know how to throw a party – nobody doubts that. But will Rio be ready to welcome over 10,000 athletes and all the international visitors for the 2016 Olympic Games?</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read this article about preparations for the Olympics in Rio, which includes different ways of talking about the future. Then answer this question: Which are the two dishes you can find in a typical Brazilian menu? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Part 1<br/></strong>'Cariocas' (Rio natives) must be <strong>having a ball</strong>, you might think. They have sun, sea, football on the beach and now the honour of hosting the world's biggest sporting event… But their days are also filled with the loud noise and dust of construction work, so you can forgive them if they don’t sound very enthusiastic about the Olympic Games at the moment. They know they will be putting up with a lot more roadworks and <strong>infrastructure</strong> building before the Olympic torch is lit in the Maracanã Stadium next 5th August.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2<br/></strong>Delays in <strong>venue</strong> construction and a <strong>chaotic</strong> appearance gave the International Olympic Committee (IOC) a<strong> fright </strong>in 2014. The Brazilian government has since <strong>cleaned up its act </strong>and was praised recently by the IOC for being “<strong>on the right track</strong>”. But what might be more difficult to clean are the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon and Guanabara Bay. They, among others, will be venues for the sailing and rowing competitions. The problem is they are heavily polluted, which could be harmful to athletes. The issue is likely to be in the news headlines for a while. There have also been stories of corruption. But the authorities hope by the time the summer comes they’ll be celebrating a scandal-free event.<br/><strong><br/>Part 3<br/></strong>Brazil has learnt a lot from hosting the World Cup last year. Some businesses realised they <strong>missed a trick</strong> by not being able to communicate properly with their international customers. This summer Brazilians will be trying out the English they've been learning and be ready to offer a good service before the first foreign sports enthusiasts stroll down the lively streets of Rio. Restaurants should realise that using the internet to translate the menu literally is not a good idea: ‘bife a cavalo’ isn’t really ‘horse steak’ - it's beef with a fried egg on top! And the intriguingly named ‘contrafilé’, which means ‘against the file’, is nothing more than a sirloin steak.<br/><strong><br/>Part 4<br/></strong>Security was a key challenge for Brazil when hosting the World Cup and it is no different for the Olympics. If London's police were concerned mainly about the possibility of terrorist attacks when the city hosted the games in 2012, Brazilian police will be working to prevent street crime. As with other developing countries, crime rates are high and there are too many guns around. Visitors are to <strong>keep </strong><strong>their wits about them</strong>. Sometimes petty thieves with only quick hands for weapons try to relieve you of your belongings.  <br/><strong><br/>Part 5<br/></strong>For those on a low budget and with a taste for adventure, there will be plenty of options for accommodation in the city’s 'favelas' or shanty towns. These do have a reputation for violent crime committed by drug gangs, as shown in the 2002 Brazilian film City of God. But some favelas have changed since a government policy called “pacification” was introduced in 2008. A number of business-minded favela residents will be welcoming tourists into their homes, which they’ve turned into guesthouses. Some favelas are on the city’s steep mountainsides, so guests will be guaranteed <strong>panoramic views</strong> of Rio at least. And of the old-style favelas… well, City of God’s co-director Fernando Meirelles is part of the team planning the Olympics opening ceremony.<br/><strong><br/>Part 6<br/></strong>So while Cariocas are already turning into athletes themselves – by jumping and running across construction sites on their daily trip to work - they know that the games might make for a great spectacle. Brazilians are warm and cheerful, and international visitors will have a good time in their company. Preparation for big events is stressful - Londoners were a bit pessimistic ahead of their Olympics. But while Brazilians might have their <strong>reservations</strong>, deep down, very deep down, they know something others don’t. As an old local saying goes: ‘Deus é Brasileiro’ (‘God is Brazilian’). They hope he will <strong>give them a hand</strong>. And whatever else, Brazilians will show the world why they have such a reputation as party people!</p>\n<p><strong>Answer to our question: </strong></p>\n<p>The two dishes mentioned in the text that you can find in a typical Brazilian menu are beef with an egg on top and sirloin steak or ‘bife a cavalo’ and ‘contrafilé’.</p>\n<p><strong>To do</strong></p>\n<p>Here are more questions for you to check how much of the article you can understand.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong><span>End of Session 3</span></strong></p>\n<p>Do you deserve a gold medal for this quiz?

I'm Catherine…</br></p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> And I'm Finn. And Catherine, I see you've got a new phone there. Was it <strong>expensive</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>It was a bit <strong>pricey</strong>, Finn, but not as <strong>dear</strong> as my last one. But, do you like it?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>I love it. I'm a little bit jealous.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>It is nice, isn't it?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And we used three words there: <strong>expensive</strong>, <strong>pricey </strong>and <strong>dear</strong> and they're all synonyms. They all mean that something cost a lot of money and they're the topic of this programme.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's right. Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meanings. And English speakers use a lot of synonyms, so it's good to learn a few.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>It certainly is. We'll give you lots of them in this programme...</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>We'll give you a quiz…</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>… and a top tip for improving your vocabulary using synonyms.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/> So, let's start by listening to Rob and Mike discussing a television advert.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> Think about this question while you listen: what kind of pet do Mike's kids have – and what was <strong>strange </strong>about it?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong>You know that <strong>funny</strong> advert where the vet thinks he's dealing with a dead cat but it's really a furry hat?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Oh yeah, it's <strong>hilarious</strong>. That <strong>look</strong> on the vet's face is so <strong>comical</strong> and the girl's <strong>expression</strong> when she picks up her hat is <strong>priceless</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Mike</strong><br/><strong>Strange </strong>thing is the same thing happened to me – quite<strong> bizarre </strong>actually – I was holding the kids' hamster while they were cleaning the cage. I thought it was a bit <strong>odd </strong>because it wasn't moving. My daughter gave me a<strong> weird </strong>look and asked why I was stroking one of her gloves!</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> So, what kind of pet do Mike's kids have – and what was <strong>strange </strong>about it?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> It was quite strange. The answer is: they have a hamster – but Mike thought it was a bit <strong>odd</strong>,because it wasn't moving.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Now<strong> strange </strong>and <strong>odd </strong>are synonyms. They both mean <strong>unusual</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Listen to this clip for two more words that Mike uses to mean strange or unusual.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong><strong>Mike<br/></strong><strong>Strange </strong>thing is the same thing happened to me – quite<strong> bizarre </strong>actually – I was holding the kids' hamster while they were cleaning the cage. I thought it was a bit <strong>odd </strong>because it wasn’t moving. My daughter gave me a<strong> weird </strong>look and asked why I was stroking one of her gloves!</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So we heard the word <strong>bizarre</strong>,spelt<strong> b-i-z-a-r-r-e</strong>,which means strange and difficult to explain. Mike thought the situation was bizarre. We also heard <strong>weird</strong>, spelt <strong>w-e-i-r-d</strong>, which also means very unusual. </p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Let's listen to another clip with some more synonyms. And this time try to spot three words that mean <strong>funny</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2   </strong><br/><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong>You know that <strong>funny</strong> advert where the vet thinks he's dealing with a dead cat but it's really a furry hat?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Oh yeah, it's <strong>hilarious</strong>. That <strong>look</strong> on the vet’s face is so <strong>comical</strong> and the girl's <strong>expression</strong> when she picks up her hat is <strong>priceless</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So <strong>hilarious</strong>,<strong> comical</strong> and <strong>priceless </strong>are all synonyms of<strong> funny</strong>. But they mean funny in a slightly different way: <strong>hilarious</strong> means very funny, in the sense that it makes you laugh out loud, <strong>comical</strong> means funny in a silly way…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>…and<strong> priceless </strong>can mean extremely funny. We usually only use it with this meaning when we're speaking. There are some other synonyms of funny, too, including<strong> humorous</strong> and<strong> amusing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And in the clip we heard two noun synonyms – <strong>look</strong> and <strong>expression</strong>, both meaning the way someone shows on their face what they are thinking or feeling.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/> You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> And we're talking about synonyms. Like <strong>strange</strong> and <strong>odd</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>…and <strong>funny</strong> and <strong>amusing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Now a word of warning – we can't always use any synonym to replace a word – it depends on the context and what exactly we're trying to say.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's right. So, for example, at the beginning of the programme, I said that my new phone was <strong>pricey</strong>, spelt <strong>p-r-i-c-e-y</strong>, and I also used the word <strong>dear</strong>, spelt<strong> d-e-a-r</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And both words are synonyms of <strong>expensive</strong>. But <strong>pricey</strong> is more informal and more modern than <strong>dear</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>So you won't see those written down very much.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Not much, no. And our top tip for learning vocabulary is: use a thesaurus, which is a dictionary of synonyms, to help you find new words and make your English more interesting. And look for example sentences with each word to help you choose the right word for each situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> And now, it's time for a quiz. Which is the odd one out? Number 1: a) expensive, b) dear, c) cheap.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>    <br/> That one is c) <strong>cheap</strong>, because the other two mean <strong>costing a lot money</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/> Very good. And number two: a) bizarre, b) hilarious, c) weird.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>    <br/> And the answer is b)<strong> hilarious</strong>. Because <strong>bizarre</strong> and<strong> weird</strong> are both synonyms of <strong>strange</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Number three: a) humorous, b) hilarious, c) expression.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And the answer to that is c)<strong> expression</strong>, because the other two are both synonyms of funny.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> And that's the end of the quiz – well done if you got them right.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Well done indeed.

The contestant didn't answer any questions correctly but got 6 points. How can this be?</p>\n<p>Look at the quiz again. What do all the answers have in common?</p>\n<p>They are all <strong>synonyms</strong> meaning '<strong>I don't know</strong>'.</p>\n<p>So in fact, it's a synonym quiz, the contestant got a point for each synonym!</p>\n<p>OK, maybe it's not the best quiz in the world but using synonyms adds variety and colour to spoken and written English.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's your chance to try a quiz. Choose the best option as the synonym for the highlighted word.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Did you get them <strong>all</strong> <strong>right</strong>? <strong>100%</strong>? <strong>All</strong> <strong>correct</strong>?<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Were you <strong>spot on</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Great</strong>! <strong>Excellent</strong>! <strong>Superb</strong>! <strong>Well done</strong>!</p>\n<p>There is more information about synonyms in the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Synonyms and collocation</h3>\n<p>Learning <strong>synonyms</strong> is a great way to improve your vocabulary, but it's also important to remember <strong>collocation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Collocation</strong> means words that 'go together'. Some words go together with other words, but their synonyms might not.</p>\n<p>Take the word <strong>unhappy</strong>, for example. There are many synonyms for <strong>unhappy</strong>. Here are just a few:</p>\n<p><strong>sad</strong>, <strong>miserable</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>downcast</strong>, <strong>down in the dumps</strong>.</p>\n<p>If someone asks you \"how are you feeling?\" you could reply with any of those words or expressions and the meaning would be clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Unhappy</strong> collocates or 'goes together with' other words and phrases. For example:</p>\n<p><em>He had <strong>an unhappy childhood</strong>. </em><br><br/>This is the best collocation for <strong>childhood</strong>. You could say <strong>a sad childhood</strong> or <strong>a miserable childhood </strong>but they don't sound quite as natural.</br></p>\n<p>The other synonyms of unhappy <strong>do not go together</strong> with childhood at all.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Adverb collocations</strong></h3>\n<p>With emotions, such as unhappiness, we often use certain adverbs. Here are some examples with different degrees of intensity, from weakest to strongest:</p>\n<p><em>\"How are you feeling?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Oh, you know, <strong>a bit</strong> / <strong>a little *</strong> / <strong>rather</strong> / <strong>quite </strong>/<strong> very  </strong>unhappy, to be honest.\"</em></p>\n<p>You can also use these adverbs with the <strong>synonyms of unhappy</strong>.</p>\n<p>*Note: although we can use <em><strong>a little </strong>we don't use <strong>a lot</strong> as an adverb before adjectives.</em></p>\n<h3>Study tip</h3>\n<p>When making a note of new vocabulary also try to find synonyms and words that go together with it. Get used to using a dictionary or thesaurus to help you. In many online programmes and web-browsers you can right click (CTRL click on a Mac) to show a menu which will give you the option to look up a word and see synonyms as well as definitions.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In this exercise you have to decide if the words or phrases are synonyms or not. You can use the information on these pages but you may also have to use a dictionary or thesaurus.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>That's the <strong>end</strong>, <strong>finish</strong>, <strong>completion </strong>of this session on synonyms! In the next session it's time for some grammar as we look at <strong>used to</strong>, <strong>be used to</strong> and <strong>get used to</strong>. Do they mean the same?</p></div>",

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>In this programme we’re looking at the phrase <strong>used to</strong> for talking about the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And we’re also looking at the phrases <strong>be used to</strong> and <strong>get used to</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>be used to</strong> sound very similar, but the meaning and forms are different. So we’ll explain the differences and give you lots of examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And we’ll have a quiz to see how much you’ve learnt, so let’s get started. Now <strong>used to</strong> is always followed by the infinitive of the verb. It tells us that an action happened regularly in the past but it doesn’t happen now. Here’s Rob with an example.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I <strong>used to eat </strong>meat, but now I’m a vegetarian.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>And <strong>used to</strong> can also describe a past situation which is no longer true. Rob.           </p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I <strong>used to be </strong>a bit overweight, but I’m much slimmer now.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That’s straightforward. So what about<strong> be used to </strong>or<strong> get used to? </strong>Well, if you<strong> are used to </strong>something, it means that it isn’t unusual or difficult for you because you have experienced it before. Rob.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>When I first became a vegetarian, I missed eating meat, but now I<strong>’m used to </strong>it.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So Rob’s familiar and comfortable with not eating meat now. He could also say:</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I <strong>got used to</strong> it after a few weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>got</strong> is like <strong>became</strong>. He became familiar with it </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now in those examples, <strong>be used to </strong>and <strong>get used to </strong>are followed by the pronoun<strong> it. </strong>But we can also use the<strong> –ing form </strong>of a verb in the same position. Listen.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I<strong>’m not used to eating </strong>food without salt. I find it really tasteless.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Rob’s not familiar with food without salt. I know how he feels - but doctors are advising us all to <strong>get used to eating</strong> less salt.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I can’t get used to eating no salt on my chips. </p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>No, that’s just wrong. It’s wrong. So there’s <strong>used to</strong> with the infinitive and <strong>be </strong>or <strong>get used to</strong> with the <strong>-ing</strong> verb. Another difference is that <strong>used to</strong> is only for the past. There is no present or future form of <strong>used to</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But we can use <strong>be</strong> or <strong>get used to</strong> in the present, past or future. Rob.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In the past, British people <strong>weren’t used to eating</strong> pasta and pizza.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That’s true. Pasta and pizza were new to Britain. But we all love them now don’t we?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, I think we<strong> got used to </strong>them pretty quickly! Even if we can’t have slat on them.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we’re looking at the phrases <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>be</strong> or <strong>get used to</strong>. And there’s another difference between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Yes, with<strong> used to, </strong>we form questions, short answers and negatives with<strong> did </strong>and<strong> didn’t. </strong>And in questions and negatives,we lose the<strong> d </strong>on the end of<strong> used. </strong>You can’t hear this because we don’t pronounce the <strong>d</strong> on <strong>used</strong> anyway. But it’s important in writing. Here’s an example. Catherine, <strong>d</strong><strong>id you use to have </strong>rice and curry when you were a child!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No, I <strong>didn’t</strong>. In fact <strong>we didn’t use to have</strong> foreign food at all in our house.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Neither did... I think the most foreign food we had was a Cornish Pasty.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very British!</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>But with<strong> be used to </strong>and<strong> get used to, </strong>we form questions, short answers and negatives with the verb<strong> be. </strong>And we keep the<strong> d </strong>on the end of<strong> used. </strong>Catherine, <strong>are you used to buying </strong>international food now?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, I am, most definitely. There’s all sorts of foreign food here in London and I’ve tried most of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Just a couple more points. There are two alternative negative forms for <strong>used to</strong>. Instead of <strong>I didn’t use to</strong>, we sometimes say <strong>I never used to</strong> or <strong>I used not to.</strong> Listen</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I never <strong>used to eat</strong> many vegetables.<br/><strong>I used not to eat</strong> many vegetables.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Just remember that <strong>used not to</strong> sounds very formal, and is mainly used in writing nowadays. Now Catherine, are there any types of foreign food that you <strong>aren’t used to?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I tried Japanese food a few times, but<strong> I can’t get used to it.  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And there is the modal auxiliary <strong>can’t</strong> with <strong>get used to</strong>. It’s a very useful piece of language. We can use it in the past as well. Rob?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>I <strong>couldn't get used to</strong> living in the countryside, so I moved back to the city.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And now it’s quiz time! Is this sentence correct or wrong? I’ve been in this job for three months so I used to it now. I’ve been in this job for three months so I used to it now.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That’s not correct. It’s <strong>I’m used to it</strong>, with the verb <strong>be</strong>. Number two. <strong>D</strong><strong>id you use </strong>to living in London when you were a child?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That’s wrong. The correct sentence is: Did you use to live in London? And number three. I don’t really like Japanese food but I hope I’ll be used to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum <br/></strong>That’s not correct. It should be <strong>I’ll get used to it</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It should! Well done at home if you got those right.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>There’s more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong>All</strong>       <br/>Bye. </p> </div>",

Read about some of the changes in Michael's life</p>\n<p>Michael is 29 years old. He's in insurance but he <strong>used to work </strong>in the entertainment industry. He <strong>used to take</strong> his holidays in the Caribbean but now he stays at home. He <strong>didn't use to be</strong> very healthy because he <strong>used to smoke a lot</strong> but recently he's given up and is feeling much better. He <strong>used to have</strong> long hair but is completely bald now. He <strong>used to play</strong> computer games a lot but doesn't have the time now. He <strong>used to be</strong> single but got married a few years ago and has a child. He <strong>didn't use to be</strong> very happy, but now he is really content in his life.</p>\n<p>When talking about things that were part of our lives in the past but aren't now, we use<strong> used to</strong>. The past things can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>habits:<br><em>He <strong>used to take</strong> his holidays in the Caribbean.<br/></em><em>He <strong>used to smoke</strong> a lot.<br/><br/></em></br></li>\n<li>states:<br/><em>He <strong>used to be</strong> single.<br/>He <strong>didn't use to be</strong> very happy.<br/><br/></em></li>\n<li>appearance:<br/><em>He <strong>used to have</strong> long hair.<br/></em><em><br/></em></li>\n<li>work and hobbies/pastimes<br/><em>He <strong>used to work</strong> in the entertainment industry.<br/>He <strong>used to play</strong> computer games a lot.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This structure is not just for personal changes. Here are some examples from the BBC News website:</p>\n<p><em>The rubber duck-shaped comet being followed by Europe's Rosetta probe <strong>used to be</strong> two separate objects.<br/>Joysticks <strong>used to be</strong> popular with gamers but have slowly been replaced by other types of game controller.<br/>A fracture runs through what <strong>used to be</strong> a lake.<br/></em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>About: used to</h3>\n<p>This form is only to talk<strong> about the past</strong>. It has <strong>no present or future form</strong>. For present habits, states, appearance etc. we use the present simple.</p>\n<p><em>I go swimming once a week. I used to go twice a day when I was training.</em></p>\n<p>The positive form is: <strong>subject + used to </strong>+ <strong>infinitive<br/></strong><em>When I was a child mum and dad <strong>used to let </strong>us play on the beach by ourselves.</em></p>\n<p>The negative is: <strong>subject + didn't use to + infinitive<br/></strong><em>We <strong>didn't use to have to</strong> be home before dark.</em></p>\n<p>The question is: <strong>Did + subject + use to + infinitive<br/></strong><em><strong>Did you use to play</strong> in the streets by yourself?</em></p>\n<p>Certain adverbs of indefinite frequency go <strong>before</strong> used to<br/><em>We <strong>never used to stay</strong> out after midnight.<br/>We <strong>always used to do</strong> what we were told.</em></p>\n<p>The <strong>s </strong>in u<strong>se</strong>/u<strong>s</strong>ed<strong> </strong>is pronounced /s/.</p>\n<p>The <strong>d </strong>in use<strong>d</strong> to is not pronounced.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>See if you've got to grips with <strong>used to</strong> by trying the quiz.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now that you've got the hang of used to, it's time to look at <strong>be used to</strong> and <strong>get used to</strong>. They have very different meanings. Find out more in the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Are you an early bird or a night owl?</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last activity was all about <strong>used to</strong> for something in the past that is different now. There are other uses for <strong>used to </strong>which have different meanings and different grammar.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Read about Karen and see if you can work out the meaning and form of the other uses.</p>\n<p><em>\"When I was younger I was a bit of a night owl. I <strong>used to</strong> stay out late three or four nights week. Then I got a job working in the city and I had to get up really early. It took me a long time to <strong>get used to</strong> the alarm going off at 6.00. Now that I <strong>am used to</strong> it, I'm more like an early bird. I really enjoy the mornings.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I <strong>used to stay </strong>out late three or four nights week.<br/></em><strong>used to</strong>: talking about something in the past that is different now.</li>\n<li><em>It took me a long time <strong>to get used to</strong> the alarm ...<br/></em><strong>to get used to something</strong>: to become familiar with and accustomed to something over a period of time.</li>\n<li><em>Now that <strong>I am used to it</strong> ...<br/></em><strong>to be used to something</strong>: to be familiar with and accustomed to something</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Not just the past</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>To be used to something</strong> and <strong>to get used to something </strong>can be used in the past and present and future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I was used to wearing shorts in the winter.<br/>I got used to wearing shorts in the winter.<br/></em></li>\n<li><em>I'm used to cycling to work in the rain.<br/>I get used to cycling in poor conditions quite easily.<br/></em></li>\n<li><em>I'll be used to this new software soon<br/>I'll get used to this new software if it kills me!</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are very close in meaning and in many cases you could use either one of them. However, <strong>to be used to something </strong>describes a situation that already exists and <strong>to get used to something</strong> highlights that it took some time to get to that state.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I'<strong>m used to eating</strong> foreign food.</em> = eating foreign food is not strange or unusual for me. </li>\n<li><em>I <strong>got used to eating</strong> foreign food. = </em><em>it took a period of time but now </em><em>eating foreign food is not strange or unusual for me.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Form </h3>\n<p>They are transitive expressions, which means they need an object. The object can be a noun, pronoun or a gerund (-ing form of a verb when it is used as a noun)</p>\n<p><strong>be used to something = subject + be + used to + object</strong></p>\n<p><strong>get used to something = subject + get + used to + object</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In questions and negatives the <strong>d</strong> in used is <strong>not</strong> dropped.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"p1\"><em>I'<strong>m not used</strong> <strong>to</strong> working so late.<br/></em><em>Have you <strong>got used to</strong> your new bed yet?</em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">The <strong>s </strong>in u<strong>s</strong>ed<strong> </strong>is pronounced /s/.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The <strong>d </strong>in use<strong>d</strong> to is not pronounced.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read this paragraph about John. Use the information here to help you rewrite this story using <strong>used to</strong>, <strong>be used to</strong> and <strong>get used to.</strong></p>\n<p><em>John lives by himself. In the past he lived with his brother. When he started living by himself he thought he would never become accustomed to it. In fact, he didn't want to become accustomed to it. He liked coming home from work and having someone to talk to and someone to cook for. He missed that but gradually he became comfortable with his situation. Now he is accustomed to talking to his cat though he still finds it difficult cooking just for himself.</em></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>We're sure you<strong>'re used to</strong> the way these session work so we probably don't need to tell you that coming up next is 6 Minute Grammar.

It's an exciting time at Tip Top Trading – the leading manufacturer of plastic imitation fruit. A new computer system - the iDo-it - is being installed that will revolutionise – or completely change – the way the office will work. The team is on a training course to learn how it works but there seems to be someone who already thinks he knows it all…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So, basically the iDo-it system is high-end software, compatible with tablets and desk tops and you can share information at the touch of a button.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>Err yes, that's what I just said.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Psst... Tom - let the trainer tell us what to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Listen, like, I'm quite an expert when it comes to technology. So mate - basically, I can open my contacts here and share it with the whole team by pressing the red button there...</p>\n<p>[Everyone groans]</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Tom what have you done? Everything has disappeared off my screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>And mine.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>You press the green button to share – red deletes everyone's contacts. It's clearly written on your handouts. [sighs] I'll come round to you one by one and reset your computers...</p>\n<p>[The team chat amongst themselves]</p>\n<p>... Right let's start with you Anna [sniffs]... hmm you smell nice, Anna...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Mate, I think you need to reboot her computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>Yes, thank you... Tom isn't it? [pause] OK, we're back in business - so Anna, this is the iDo-it home screen - just press that, accept that, move that there and Bob's your uncle. So go on, you have a go and I'll be back in a minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Bob's my uncle? But he's not.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>It's just a saying Anna - he means he's done it easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Well, it doesn't seem easy to me. </p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>It sounds like you need to ask for help Anna. Try politely asking for help and saying 'I can't work it out' and you could also say 'I can't get my head round this.'</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>My head?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Yes, if you can't get your head round something it means you can't understand it. Give it a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>OK thanks. [To trainer] Hmm excuse me, I need some help, please.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>What seems to be the problem?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>I'm sorry but... I can't work it out - you said press this and open this... but nothing happens. Oh, I can't get my head round this new system - and we have to start using it next week.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Oh I know - it's terrible. Can't we just go back to using pen and paper - and a fax machine like we used to?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>You can't stop progress Denise - although progress seems to have stopped you.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Silly boy!</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>Could we all concentrate on the computers please. Now Anna, let me explain one more time. Say you want to share this file with Denise's computer - you upload it here and she can download it here from the cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>The cloud?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah, it only works when it rains! So, mate we're talking about a 200 megabit per second transfer rate unless you're on Bluetooth of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>Erm?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Idiot! Is he like this at home Anna?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>No - I think he's just showing off. But I just don't understand this new system.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>OK then - say 'I'm having trouble getting to grips with this' and 'this isn't sinking in'.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Sinking in? To where?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Sinking in to your brain. You've got a good brain Anna so I reckon if it's not sinking in, it can't be a very good system. Go on then, try those phrases...</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>I will. [To trainer] Excuse me again... it's Bob isn't it? Bob - I'm sorry but I'm having trouble getting to grips with this - it really isn't sinking in - can you explain one more time please?</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Yes, and when you've finished with Anna, could help me 'get to grips with it'?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Err, I thought you were the 'expert' mate!</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>I am doing my best - but for some reason... ah I see, you need to put in your password first Anna... could you do that please?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>OK, let me see - if I do that, then that and that - yes, it works! Oh thank you, thank you so much.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>You're welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Err, what about me?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Well done Anna! You've managed to explain your difficulty in trying to understand a new computer system by using these phrases...</p>\n<p><em>I can't work it out.</em><br/><em>I can't get my head round this.</em><br/><em>I'm having difficulty getting to grips with this.</em><br/><em>This isn't sinking in.</em></p>\n<p>It's always hard learning a new computer system and it looks like even Tom is having problems…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>I can't work it out - if I put in my password - nothing happens!</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Having difficulty getting to grips with the system Tom?!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Enter... enter... arghh, why won't it work! [sfx: hits the computer followed by an explosion]</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Oh Tom! It looks like the technology has beaten you.</p>\n<p><strong>Trainer</strong><br/>Yeah and I thought you were 'the expert'! You're going to have to pay for this.</p> </div>",

We spoke to six students who are studying English at Rose of York school here in the UK's capital to find out their experiences since moving here. What things were they <strong>not used to</strong>? What are they <strong>getting used to</strong>? And what tips do they have for others who want to move here?</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read our tips. They contain examples of this unit's language. After you read there will be a quiz to test your understanding!</p>\n<h3>Seven top tips!</h3>\n<p><strong>1) Save money first<br/></strong>Hlib from Ukraine says that London is a \"friendly, but expensive city\". So, before you come to the UK, do try to save some money!</p>\n<p><strong>2) Practise your language – but don't worry too much<br/></strong>Suleyman from Turkmenistan says that getting used to the British accent is important. But Vladimir from Kazakhstan says people don't worry too much about accent, it's more important to communicate with <strong>clarity</strong>. He added that getting used to the speed of speech was also a challenge. And Hlib believes that pronunciation can be difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Make friends<br/></strong>\"London is a <strong>melting pot</strong>,\" says Vladimir. Because of this it's easy to meet people from all over the world, but not so easy to meet Londoners, in these students' experience. Julia from Germany is an <strong>au pair</strong> and has made friends through the family she lives and works with.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Don't waste your time<br/></strong>When Aijamal from Kyrgyzstan was first here she felt \"<strong>homesick</strong>\". But time is precious, so now she \"regrets wasting that time.\" She urges visitors: \"Don't sit at home.\" <strong>Make the most of </strong>each day!</p>\n<p><strong>5) Don't worry about the food<br/></strong>You might have heard stories that British food is not <strong>appetising</strong>. But as Hector from Chile says: \"You can find food from every country here.\" So don't worry if you're not used to a full English breakfast!</p>\n<p><strong>6) Get an app<br/></strong>Navigating the transport system can be challenging. Julia says that getting around the city takes planning. One good way stay organised is to download an <strong>app</strong>, \"so you can know where you are and where you have to go,\" says Julia. But she's still not used to the way cars drive on the street: \"In Germany we drive on the right-hand side, so when I cross the street I don't know which way to look, because I'm a bit confused!\"</p>\n<p><strong>7) Get outside the city<br/></strong>Suleyman says he's not used to how busy London is - he says this one city is the same size as his whole home country of Turkmenistan! Sometimes it's good to have a break. And if you want to experience traditional British culture, says Vladimir, you have to get outside the big city.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now, how much did you understand? Answer these questions.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Your turn</h3>\n<p>Are you a student in the UK? Or maybe in another country away from home? What aren't you used to? What are you getting used to?</p>\n<p>Write about your experiences in another country. Make sure you use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>getting used to</li>\n<li>not used to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Shang from China, and Tomi from Japan</h3>\n<p>We have both been students in the University of Brighton since last month. We study Art and Design courses.</p>\n<p>Food<br/>We are getting used to eating the food here but it is not easy for us to eat some of it like rice, fish and dessert because we are used to eating soft rice and fresh seafood in our countries. Some cakes and bread are too sweet to eat. Also, all of them are more expensive than our countries. </p>\n<p>Transport<br/>We must pay high prices for to get on the bus and the train. However, just 10 pence is enough to take a bus in China while in Japan we need only under £1. We are  used to saying \"hello\" and \"thank you\". </p>\n<h3>Anazilda, Brasil</h3>\n<p>Last year, I spent a month studying English at London. It was a terrific but difficult time.</p>\n<p>Although I'd saved money previously, London is more expensive than I've thought. So, it took time to get used to its prices. I used to check the figures out before buying anything.</p>\n<p>It was also difficult to get used to British food, very spicy and fat. I used to go to a supermarket and buy some fresh fruits and bread and they were my meals almost ervery day. But, once and than, I squandered a lot in one of those superb restaurants.</p>\n<p>It was also difficult to make friends. I am a shy person, I am not used to making acquaintece with strangers. And I was ashamed of my poor accent, so I rather talked with the teachers. I regret it, I thing I could have made the most of those days.</p>\n<h3>Akin, Turkey</h3>\n<p>I have never been another country yet. I was burn in Türkiye, and live in Türkiye. I guess If I go to another country I will find difficulty getting used to live with  people have different culture. Because of this I'm not an easy going person. So this matter will be spread all of my relationship and experience. It tooks much time me. it's difficult to get used to different food of other country for me. I always will my wife's meats. But that's excatly true that I can never able to get used to wheel which on the right side.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Juan, Spain</h3>\n<p>When I was student I sometimes used to go to a foreign country during the summer time. There I studied the native language, knew new people, places and customs while I worked and saved some money at the same time.</p>\n<p>The first summer I went to England and lived in Sussex county, in a nice town by the sea. I didn't use to work all the day but just in the mornings. In the afternoons I was used to studying the country's language, some days in an English school. It was difficult at the beginning though after a few months I got used to understanding, which was fantastic because I thought I'll never get used to understanding it.</p>\n<p>In the evenings we, me and a couple of friends, used to go to discos, bars or something else. They were gorgeous and unforgettable summers.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>The last year I had to travel to Arequipa city in Peru. When I was there, I ate different kinds of seafood, that I never had eaten it, because in Colombia I was used to eat the food of my own region, for example, hen soup, grilled beef with potatoes and foods without any kind of  shellfish or fish, but in Peru  I started to get used to it, especially this dish (pulpo al olivo), it is really delicious, also I drank a cocktail, it's name is Pisco sour, it is very strong because it is an alcoholic drink. fortunately I'm not used to drink strong drinks but this drink I like it too much.</p>\n<h3>Anastasiya, Russia</h3>\n<p>I'm a homebody, but I can tell you about my younger sister Ann. She used to study at Sotheby's Institute of art. She lived in London for three year. Her work is all about contemporary art and she doesn't mind going at any distant place to make arrangements to an exhibition or to meet with unknown, but really gifted artist. She was used to understanding different accents of Londoners such as Polish, Scottish (she admit that it's very difficult), Indian. But she wasn't used to dealing with British people. Ann said, they were too formal. May be, she meant, most of people are a bit unfriendly compared to her. There are loads of regulations and rules at everyday life in Britain and people don't break them. She got used to law-abiding citizens all over London and very slowly she became similar to them. Ann is into fitness and at first she was surprised. In Russia men don't like to attend fitness classes at all. They prefer street workout, cycling, football and such sort of things. She was used to seeing mainly women at fitness-clubs in our home country. But in London as men as women lead healthy lifestyle and do fitness.</p>\n<p>Also Ann disliked British changeable weather, she wasn't used to it. Now she lives and works in Dubai. It's too hot there and she is missing British frogs and rains. In Saudi Arabia Ann is getting used to wearing lenten (I mean, simple) clothes, because of strict regulations of this Muslim country.</p>\n<h3>Mauro, Italy</h3>\n<p>I was sent to London in 1981 by the company I worked for to study English. I desperately needed it for my job. I had to get used to the school itself and the intensive way to learn English in about four weeks. I was not used to have so many teachers in the same day, nearly one every two hours, neither I was not used to have my mates, only four each class, changed every three days. I had to get used to study and practice both during the school hours and out of them, totally forgetting my language  also when I was dreaming at night. The teachers were superb, some of them were actors, I wasnt used to also study as I actually was acting at theatre. All of this improved my English really a lot and was very useful for my job and my many my travels around the world.</p>\n<h3>Vincenzo, Italy</h3>\n<p>Some years ago I attended a course at the University of Southampton, in the UK. The day was structured according to the English standards. After a rich breakfast, there were three hours of lessons in the morning. Then we used to have a light lunch, followed by three hours of lessons and exercises. Dinner was served at 7:30pm. At the beginning I was not used to this kind of daily schedule; however, everything became natural in a short time. I believe that enthusiasm and motivations are very helpful when you’re getting used to something new.</p>\n<h3>Audience, China</h3>\n<p>Hello uncle and aunt editors, I am a kid from Chinese now learning in Japan, I am easily getting used to the written words of japanese but not used to its spoken language at all. I am not appreciating the traditional food as well as their \"chinese food\". Gladly I at last begin getting used to breathe the wet air here. A bit embarrassing  is that I are n't used to the clean streets. I am not used to see foreigners so regularly will be used to it soon.</p>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>And that's it for this unit. Next, we join Gulliver on his travels in our drama. Gulliver has escaped from the land of tiny people in Lilliput – but his adventures don't end there… he has a 'giant' surprise in store for him!</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine…</br></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And I'm Finn. Now make sure you pay <strong>attention</strong> because we have a lot of <strong>information</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's right… and <strong>attention </strong>and <strong>information</strong> are a good <strong>introduction</strong> to the programme.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>They are. They both end in<strong> 'shun'</strong> /ʃ(ə)n/, which is the suffix we're talking about.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Suffixes are groups of letters at the end of words which can change the form or meaning of a word, or both.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>And we'll tell you about the three different ways to spell the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And we'll give you examples of words with all three spellings, plus some tips for knowing which spelling to use…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>We'll have a quiz…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>…and we'll finish with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>But first, let's hear a news report about the theft of a valuable statue.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Where was the statue from? Here’s the report.</p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong>A man was charged today following an <strong>investigation </strong>into the theft of valuable objects from the museum. The man confessed after witnesses came forward with <strong>information</strong> and his <strong>description </strong>appeared in the newspapers. In his <strong>confession</strong>,he said that he had gained<strong> admission </strong>to the museum by pretending to be a security guard. Police recovered items including a priceless <strong>Venetian</strong> vase and an <strong>Egyptian</strong> statue.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So, we asked you: Where was the statue from?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>And the answer is: Egypt. It was <strong>Egyptian</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That's right. And the word <strong>Egyptian </strong>has the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-a</strong>-<strong>n</strong>. And we usually find this spelling in adjectives that describe where something or someone comes from.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So, the stolen <strong>Egyptian</strong> statue came from Egypt…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Exactly, and the <strong>Venetian </strong>vase came from <strong>Venice</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>In these examples, the suffix <strong>'shun', </strong>spelt<strong> t-i-a-n,</strong> turns the noun into an adjective; and these adjectives are often written with a capital letter because they come from proper nouns. Now, another example is <strong>Martian -</strong> and Martians come from <strong>Mars</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>I suppose they do. Let's listen to another clip with more words that end in<strong> 'shun'</strong>. See if you can spot them.</p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong>A man was charged today following an <strong>investigation </strong>into the theft of valuable objects from the museum. The man confessed after witnesses came forward with <strong>information</strong> and his <strong>description </strong>appeared in the newspapers.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So we had three words ending in <strong>'shun'</strong> - <strong>investigation</strong>, <strong>description</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>…and <strong>information</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Now here, the<strong> 'shun' </strong>at the end is spelt<strong> t-i-o-n</strong>.This is the most usual spelling for <strong>'shun'</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And words with <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-o-n</strong> are nouns. They usually come from verbs.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So the word <strong>investigation</strong> comes from the verb <strong>investigate</strong>… the word <strong>description</strong> comes from <strong>describe</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>…and the word <strong>information</strong> comes from the verb <strong>inform</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>There are many words with this spelling of <strong>'shun'</strong>. We told you to pay <strong>attention</strong> at the start of the programme…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yep and there are other words like <strong>addition</strong>,<strong> subtraction</strong>,<strong> accommodation</strong>,<strong> population</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Many, many more. So that’s words with the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-o-n </strong>and <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>. Now let's look at the third spelling of the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>: <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And here they are in another clip.</p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span></strong>In his <strong>confession</strong>,he said thathe had gained<strong> admission </strong>to the museum by pretending to be a security guard.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>So we had<strong> confession </strong>and<strong> admission.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yes, nouns with the ending <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>s-i-o-n</strong> are often based on words ending in double <strong>-s</strong> or -<strong>m-i-t</strong> like <strong>confession</strong> from <strong>confess</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>E</strong><strong>xpression</strong> from <strong>express</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>… <strong>discussion</strong> from <strong>discuss</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>…<strong>admission</strong> from <strong>admit…</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>…and <strong>permission </strong>from <strong>permit</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And we're talking about the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>. We can spell it in three different ways…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>There's <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>, as in <strong>Egyptian</strong> or <strong>Venetian. </strong>These are adjectives which indicate someone or something's origin.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Or we can spell it <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>. And these words are nouns and are often based on verbs ending in -<strong>s-s</strong>, like <strong>discussion</strong> from <strong>discuss</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>…or verbs ending in<strong> -t </strong>like <strong>permission</strong> from <strong>permit</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And finally, the most common spelling <strong>t-i-o-n</strong>, as in nouns like<strong> information</strong> and <strong>ambition</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Oh, ambition, yeah. Catherine, do you have a secret <strong>ambition</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>I have an ambition. It's not so secret but I would love to go to Africa on a safari. What about you, Finn?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Oh, yes, travel as well. I’d love to travel through South America one day.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>I hope you get to do it.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Quite soon. Now, time for a quiz. What is the correct spelling for the ending of these words. Is it<strong> t-i-o-n, s-i-o-n, </strong>or<strong> t-i-a-n? </strong> Ready?</p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>OK…</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Number one: <strong>Egyptian…</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Egyptian is <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Good. Number two: <strong>permission.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Permission: <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And number three: <strong>attention.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>Attention ends with the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt<strong> t-i-o-n</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Fantastic. And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>And now, here's a top tip for learning vocabulary: to help you learn new words, try linking them into a story.

Listen to this spy story (it's about a minute long) How many words can you find in this extract from a spy story that end with the sound <strong>'shun'</strong> - /ʃ(ə)n/ or <strong>'jhun'</strong> - /ʒ(ə)n/?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<h3>Same sound, different spelling</h3>\n<p>Did you find all the words?

These words are all nouns. They are often, but not always, noun versions of verbs. For example, verbs ending in <strong>te - </strong>drop the <strong>e </strong>and add <strong>tion:</strong></p>\n<p><em>complete - comple<strong>tion</strong></em><br><em>accommodate - accommoda<strong>tion</strong></em><br/><em>communicate - communica</em><strong><em>tion<br/></em><br/></strong></br></p>\n<h3><strong>-sion</strong></h3>\n<p>This is less common than <strong>-tion </strong>and is used with verbs ending in <strong>-d</strong>, <strong>-de</strong>, and <strong>-se</strong>.

But this is 6 Minute Grammar, not 16 Minute Grammar.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>If I’d known you were going to be so bossy, I’d’ve stayed in bed.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Mmm. So what is today’s topic? If you’ve been paying attention, you might have worked it out.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We’ve had a lot of ‘ifs’, that is a bit of a clue.            <br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It is indeed. Today we’re reviewing conditionals. <br/><br/><strong>Finn        <br/></strong>Conditional sentences connect two things. One thing follows on from something else.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Conditional sentences generally have two parts, the <strong>conditional</strong> <strong>clause</strong>, which is sometimes called the <strong>if clause</strong>, and a <strong>main clause</strong>. The <strong>if clause</strong> states a condition and the <strong>main clause</strong> has what happens because of that condition.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And there are different kinds of conditional structures depending on whether we’re dealing with something in the present or past and if we’re talking about something real or imagined. <br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>We normally talk about four different conditional structures. The first one is called the zero conditional. Here’s an example from earlier. Let’s wind back a bit. <strong><br/><br/>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>When I come to the studio, I read the script.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Now Finn, what time does that refer to?<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It’s not really past, present or future, is it? It’s timeless. It’s always. <br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And this is what the zero conditional is for. Things that are always true, things that always happen. One thing happens, something else follows. <br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It’s also commonly used for general truths and facts. Like in these examples.<br/><br/><strong>Feifei<br/></strong><em>When you heat water enough, it boils.</em><br/><em>If you leave milk out long enough, it goes bad.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And in zero conditionals, <strong>when </strong>and <strong>if</strong> have the same meaning. Let’s move on now to the first conditional.<br/><br/><strong>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well if you give me a few minutes, I’ll just give it a quick read.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Finn, what time does this refer to?<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>This one is about something that might happen in the future. I’ll read the script.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Will that definitely happen?<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No, it’ll only happen after a particular condition is met, and that condition is that you give me enough time.<br/><br/><strong>Callum</strong><br/>With the first conditional, you can use <strong>when</strong> as well as <strong>if</strong> but unlike the zero conditional, they do have different meanings. Listen to these examples.<br/><br/><strong>Feifei<br/></strong><em>If I go to the shops, I’ll get some bread.</em><br/><em>When I go to the shops, I’ll get some bread.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So Finn: “If I go to the shops”. Am I definitely going to the shops?<br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><br/>No, not this time. It’s a possibility, but not definite.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And what about: “When I go to the shops”?<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>In this one, using <strong>when</strong>, there is a definite plan to go to the shops.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So the first conditional expresses a likely result of a possible or definite future condition.<br/><strong><br/>IDENT       <br/></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Today we’re reviewing different conditional forms. <br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We’ve looked at zero and first conditionals, and it was Callum who gave us an example of the second conditional.<br/><br/><strong>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>I’d love to give you a few minutes if we had the time.<br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><strong><br/></strong>What time does this refer to, Callum?<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>It’s an imaginary present time – do we have the time now? No we don’t. It’s making a prediction about something that could be possible if something in the present were different. We’re imagining a different present reality.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Wow. That's very sci-fi, Callum!<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And now the third conditional. Let’s go back again and here the example.<strong><br/><br/>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>If I’d known you were going to be so bossy, I’d’ve stayed in bed.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Finn, what time are we talking about here?<br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><br/>We’re talking about the past, but something that didn’t happen in the past.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Yes, you didn’t know when you got up this morning that I was going to be so bossy.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No, my past action would have been different, if I had known. I would have stayed in bed!<br/><br/><strong>Callum</strong><br/>So with the third conditional were imagining a different past reality.<br/><br/><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Very good. That’s right. Very sci-fi again Callum.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Now, just time for a quick quiz. You’re going to hear a sentence and you need to work out whether it’s a zero, first, second or third conditional. Here’s the first one:<br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><br/>If you drop the price, you’ll sell more.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>That’s first conditional. Here’s the next one:<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>If I were you, I’d take the job.</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And that one is second conditional. What about this one?<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>When I’ve had a busy day, I want some peace and quiet when I get home.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Did you get it? That was the zero conditional.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done if you got all of those right. <br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>If we had more time we could tell you a lot more about conditionals.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But we don’t, so we’re going to say goodbye for now, and remind you that there's more about this topic on our website <strong>bbclearningenglish.com</strong>. Do join us again soon for more 6 Minute Grammar.<br/><br/><strong>Both</strong>           <br/>Bye.</p>\n<p> </p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What is a conditional sentence?</h3>\n<p>Conditional sentences connect two things: a <strong>condition</strong> and a <strong>result</strong>. Something happens <strong>as a result of</strong> something else, or happens <strong>only if a certain condition is met</strong>.</p>\n<p>The condition and the result can be real or imagined and can refer to past, present or future time. The condition part of the sentence is called the <strong>if clause</strong>, or sometimes the <strong>conditional clause</strong>. The result part of the sentence is known as the <strong>result clause</strong>, or sometimes the<strong> main clause</strong>. </p>\n<p>The conditional clause and the main clause can be in any order. If the if clause is first, there is <strong>a comma between the clauses</strong>. There is <strong>no comma</strong> if the result clause is first.</p>\n<p>There are different structures for conditionals, including four types known as <strong>zero</strong>,<strong> first</strong>,<strong> second </strong>and<strong> third conditionals</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><em>If you heat water enough, it boils. </em><strong>Zero conditional</strong></p>\n<p><em>If I go to the shops, I'll get some milk. </em><strong>First conditional</strong></p>\n<p><em>If I won the lottery, I'd still carry on working. </em><strong>Second conditional</strong></p>\n<p><em>If I hadn't missed the bus, I wouldn't have met the love of my life. </em><strong>Third conditional</strong></p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Zero Conditional</h3>\n<p><em>If you heat water enough, it boils.</em></p>\n<p>Does water boil all by itself? No. The condition that makes it boil is the heating.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>condition = heating</li>\n<li>result = boiling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When will this happen? Any time the condition is met. This kind of conditional is used for general truths, facts and everyday occurrences. It's not really connected to any particular time.</p>\n<p>The <strong>result </strong>and <strong>if </strong><strong>clauses</strong> both have present verb forms. In the <strong>if clause</strong>, either <strong>if </strong>or <strong>when </strong>can be used - they have the<strong> same meaning</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>If / When you leave milk out long enough, it goes bad.</em><br><em>If / When I leave after 8.30, I miss the bus.<br/>If / When I've had a hard day at work, I like to come home to peace and quiet.</em></br></p>\n<h3>First conditional</h3>\n<p><em>If I go to the shops, I'll get some milk.</em></p>\n<p>Will I definitely get some milk? No. The condition that leads to getting milk is going to the shops. I might not go to the shops.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>condition = going to the shops</li>\n<li>result = buying bread</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike the zero conditional, this is not a general truth or scientific fact. It's talking about a specific time and event, and not something that's always true. It's talking about a time in the future and something that might happen then.</p>\n<p>The <strong>if clause</strong> has a present verb form. The <strong>result clause</strong> takes <strong>will</strong> +<strong> infinitive without to </strong>when we are certain that the result will happen if the condition is met. If we're not certain, we can use a <strong>modal verb</strong> like <strong>may</strong> or<strong> might</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>If I see Mike, I'll tell him about the party.</em><br/><em>If you get home before me, can you put the chicken in the oven?</em><br/><em>If I pass my exams, I might get a pay rise.</em></p>\n<p>You can use <strong>when</strong> instead of <strong>if </strong>in the if clause, but the meaning is different. Compare:</p>\n<p><em>If I go to the shops, I'll get some milk.<br/></em>Am I going the shops? Perhaps, it's a possibility.</p>\n<p><em>When I go to the shops, I'll get some milk.<br/></em>Am I going to the shops? Probably, it's a plan.</p>\n<p>For more informaton about zero and first conditionals, see <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-5/session-2\" target=\"_self\">Unit 5</a></p>\n<h3>Second conditional</h3>\n<p>The second conditional is about imaginary results of impossible or unlikely conditions in the present or future.</p>\n<p><em>If I won a million pounds, I'd still carry on working.<br/></em>Will l win the lottery? It's possible but I think it's very unlikely.</p>\n<p><em>If I had that much money, I'd give up my job</em> <em>immediately</em>.<br/>Do I have that much money? No, I don't.<br/><br/>The <strong>if clause</strong> contains the <strong>past</strong> <strong>simple</strong>. There is, however, one exception: if the verb <strong>to </strong><strong>be </strong>is in the if clause, use <strong>were</strong> and not <strong>was </strong>in the first and second person singular. The main clause contains <strong>would </strong>(or other modals such as <strong>could</strong> or <strong>might</strong>) followed by the <strong>infinitive without to</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>If I were you, I'd take a holiday!<br/>If you loaned me some money, I could buy a new car.<br/>If I had the time, I could finish the gardening. But I'm too busy with work.</em></p>\n<h3>Third conditional</h3>\n<p>We use this conditional to talk about an imaginary result of something in the past.</p>\n<p><em>If I hadn't missed the bus, I wouldn't have met the love of my life.<br/></em>Did I miss the bus? Yes I did, so the result is purely imagined.</p>\n<p>The <strong>if clause</strong> has a <strong>past perfect</strong> structure and the <strong>result clause</strong> has <strong>would</strong> (or other modals such as <strong>could</strong> or <strong>might</strong>) + <strong>have</strong> + <strong>past participle</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>If I had studied harder at college, I could have gone to a better university.<br/>If we had never met, my life would have been a lot less complicated.<br/>If hadn't taken the job, I might have regretted it.</em></p>\n<p>You can see more about the second and third conditionals in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-9/session-2\" target=\"_self\">Unit 9</a>.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the activity, check to see if you can identify different conditional structures.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>In the next activity we look at conditionals that don't fit the zero, first, second or third patterns. And of course, there's another quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Not just Zero to Third</h3>\n<p>In the last activity we highlighted four different conditional structures with regular patterns. These aren't the only possible conditional forms, though.</p>\n<h3>Mixed conditionals</h3>\n<p>Compare these two sentences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If I had studied harder at university, I could have got a good job.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(I didn't study hard enough <strong>in the past</strong>, so I didn't get a good job <strong>in the past</strong>.)</p>\n<p>This is a standard <strong>third conditional</strong> about a condition and result <strong>in the past</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If I had taken the job, I would be much wealthier now.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(I didn't take the job <strong>in the past</strong>, so I'm not much wealthier now <strong>in the present</strong>.)</p>\n<p>This is a <strong>mixed conditional</strong>. The past situation leads to a result <strong>in the present</strong>, not the past.</p>\n<p>The structure of this mixed conditional takes the <strong>if clause from the third conditional</strong> (past perfect) and <strong>result clause from the second conditional</strong> (modal verb + infinitive without to).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If you'd taken the medicine, you'd be better by now.</em></li>\n<li><em>You wouldn't be so tired if you'd gone to bed in time.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another type of mixed conditional matches <strong>the if clause from the second conditional</strong> (past simple) with a <strong>result clause from the third conditional </strong>(modal verb + have +past participle). </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If I were taller, I could have caught it.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not tall enough (<strong>now or in the past</strong>), so I didn't reach it.</p>\n<p>In this mixed conditional a continuing situation or permanent condition has influenced something in the past. Note that this condition was the same in the past as it is in the present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If I were braver, I'd have picked up the spider and taken it outside.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not brave enough (<strong>now or in the past</strong>), so I didn't pick up the spider (<strong>in the past</strong>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If I didn't have so much homework, I would have gone to the cinema.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have a lot of homework (<strong>now and in the recent past</strong>), I didn't go to the cinema (<strong>in the past</strong>).</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>More first conditionals</h3>\n<p>Can you remember the basic pattern for a first conditional? If you can't, here it is again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If you order it, I'll pay for it.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If clause: <strong>present form</strong><br>Result clause: will + <strong>infinitive without to</strong></br></p>\n<p><strong><br/></strong>There are some other ways a first conditional can be formed. You can have a <strong>modal </strong>like<strong>can</strong>, <strong>may</strong> or <strong>should</strong>, in the if clause or result clause, as well as <strong>future with going to</strong> or <strong>present continuous for future</strong>. You can also have <strong>the imperative</strong> in the result clause. Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><em>If you <strong>can't</strong> understand the instructions, you'll never be able to assemble the wardrobe.</em></p>\n<p><em>If I give you some money, <strong>could</strong> you get me some wine at the supermarket?</em></p>\n<p><em>If the weather's good on Sunday, we're <strong>going to</strong> have a picnic in Hyde Park.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you're <strong>going to</strong> write him a cheque, <strong>make sure</strong> there's enough money in your account to cover it.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you're <strong>not coming home</strong> until after midnight, your dinner will be in the dog.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you're hungry, <strong>help yourself</strong> to something from the fridge.</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>How are you feeling about conditionals now? <strong>If you're</strong> ready, <strong>do</strong> our quiz to test your knowledge! (Which conditional was that?)</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>How did you do? Ready to relax?

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Fame didn't quite come to singer-songwriter Sixto Rodriguez in the 1970s, but he got a second chance to <strong>make it</strong> in the 1990s almost by chance. How did it happen?</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Read this article quite quickly the first time and try to answer this question: why did South African fans think Sixto was dead? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>What were Sixto Rodriguez's chances of success? \"He's got it,\" said a music producer who spotted his talent. But Sixto's start in life wasn't very <strong>promising</strong>. He was the seventh child of a Mexican-American family who came to the US to work in the industrial city of Detroit. His tough life may have helped him in another way, though: if Sixto hadn't been exposed to working-class life and poverty, would he have written such <strong>compelling</strong> lyrics? He was playing in a bar in the late 1960s when a couple of producers thought they had found the next Bob Dylan - the rebellious, iconic musician. They made Sixto into a recording artist.</br></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>Two albums – Cold Fact and Coming to Reality – were released and Sixto was widely praised. If the records had sold lots of copies, he would have been be on track for a great career. But they didn't and the music label dropped the artist. His third album was never released. Mike Theodore, who co-produced his first album, admits he is <strong>haunted</strong> to this day by the failure: \"Rodriguez at that time had all the machinery in place - big names, big money behind it. <strong>Circumstances</strong> were right, why didn't it make it? Did he get enough promotion? Did he do enough performances? Was he too political? Was there this, was there that…? On and on you can go but at the end of the day if you listen to his stuff now you say: I don't understand, and he's right on.\" In the end, it wasn't meant to be. Sixto took up construction work to pay the bills. For him, that was it. But was it?</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>It would have been<strong> curtains</strong> for the musician's career if a copy of Cold Fact hadn't found its way to <strong>apartheid</strong> South Africa. <strong>Bootleg</strong> copies became a kind of soundtrack to youth protests against segregation. Rodriguez fan Craig Bartholomew-Strydom says: \"Any revolution needs an anthem and in South Africa Cold Fact was the album that gave people permission to free their minds and start thinking differently.\" He and his friend Stephen 'Sugar' Segerman went on a <strong>quest</strong> to find out more about this mysterious musician that American magazines didn't talk about. There were <strong>rumours</strong> that Sixto had killed himself on stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>Bartholomew-Strydom was also a journalist, and followed the money trail to find out who was getting the <strong>royalties</strong> from Sixto's songs. He uncovered the artist's story and wrote an article about him. This would have been the end of it if the article hadn't found its way to Sixto's eldest daughter in America. She got in touch with the South African fans, who brought the very surprised former musician, then in his 50s, to play six <strong>sold out</strong> concerts in the country in 1998. It would have been a good enough story of second chances if it stopped here. But, it got better. Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul decided to turn it into a documentary called Searching for Sugar Man. He said: \"It's the best story I have ever heard in my life. It's a true Cinderella story. It's better than Cinderella because Cinderella didn't have as good a soundtrack.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5</strong><br/>If Sixto's <strong>fairy godmothers</strong> were his South African fans, Bendjelloul's were his film world connections. He knew a few British producers, and later the Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore and Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin <strong>championed</strong> his project. It took the Swedish filmmaker five years to complete the documentary because of problems with funding. But his persistence <strong>paid off</strong>: Cinderella went to the ball and Bendjelloul went to the Oscars' ceremony in 2013 and left with an award of his own for Best Documentary Feature. And what happened to Sixto, you may ask? Now in his 70s, the musician lives in the same <strong>rundown</strong> house in Detroit. A simple man and a true poet, he seems content and <strong>plays down</strong> comparisons with Bob Dylan: \"Well, I've only written 30 songs. Bob Dylan has written over 500. So he's the Shakespeare of rock and roll and certainly deserves that title.\"</p>\n<p>Well, just 30 songs were enough to give Sixto Rodriguez <strong>a second bite of the cherry</strong>! This alone says a lot about his talent.<br/><br/><strong>Answer to our question: </strong></p>\n<p>Sixto Rodriguez's South African fans thought he was dead because there were <strong>rumours</strong> he had killed himself on stage.</p>\n<p><strong>To do</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some more questions to check how much of the article you understood.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>Did you get most of them right?

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Hi, I'm Finn, and I'm here with another programme teaching you real, functional English. This time it's: making polite requests. Now that's when you want someone to do something for you. So you could say something like:</span></p>\n<p><span>Please write the report by the end of today.</span></p>\n<p><span>But that sounds a little bit too direct. There are other ways to make requests which are more polite, and more likely to make the other person feel OK!</span></p>\n<p><span>So, I've asked Neil and Rob to help out with these examples. Neil wants Rob to finish editing a programme, but Rob doesn't seem too keen. Listen to the different ways Neil asks him to do this. How many different ways does he use?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Morning Rob.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Hi Neil.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>How's that programme coming along? <strong>Would you mind</strong> sending it to me when it's finished?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Yeah sure, I can do that.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So Rob, <strong>is there any chance you could</strong> send me that programme you've been promising me?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>OK. I'll do my best.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So Rob. <strong>Are you OK to </strong>send that programme soon?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Yeah, sure.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So Rob, that programme we were talking about earlier. <strong>I'd really appreciate it if you could</strong> send it over to me.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>I'll try.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So, Rob, <strong>if you could </strong>send me that programme for checking, <strong>that would be</strong> <strong>really great</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Right, I'll do my best.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Have you started it?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Soon, soon.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>So there we are. And - oops - sounds like poor Rob hasn't even started it yet! </span><span>So Neil made five requests there. He said:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Would you mind</em></strong><em> sending it to me…?</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Is there any chance you could</em></strong><em> send it to me…?</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Are you OK to</em></strong><em> send it…?</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>I'd appreciate it if you could</em></strong><em> send it…</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>If you could </em></strong><em>send it, <strong>that would be</strong> great…</em></span></p>\n<p><span>Let's look at each of those in turn. The first three, we can learn as chunks:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Would you </em><em>mind</em><em>…?</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Are you OK </em><em>to</em><em>…?</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Is there any chance you </em><em>could</em><em>…?</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Firstly, <strong>would you mind...? </strong>Now, this is really common. It's usually followed by a verb in the -ing form, like this:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Would you mind</em></strong><em><strong> lending</strong> me five pounds?</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Would you </em><em>mind</em></strong><em><strong> sending </strong>me an email with that information?</em></span></p>\n<p><span>There we are, <strong>would you mind...?</strong> Next, <strong>are you OK to...?</strong> Now this is followed by the verb in the infinitive, like this:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Are you OK to</em></strong><em> <strong>send</strong> it today?</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Are you OK to</em></strong><em> <strong>finish</strong> it this afternoon?</em></span></p>\n<p><span>This one, <strong>are you OK to...?</strong> is more often used in a work context, rather than in a situation with someone you don't know.</span></p>\n<p><span>The next chunk we can learn is – <strong>is there any chance you could..</strong>.<strong>?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Neil said – <strong>is there any chance you could</strong> send it to me?</span></p>\n<p><span>So this one is followed by the infinitive as well:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Is there any chance you could</em></strong><em> <strong>send…?</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Is there any chance you could</em></strong><em> <strong>send</strong> me that information?</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>Is there any chance you could </em></strong><em><strong>make</strong> a cake for her party?</em></span></p>\n<p><span>Great. Now finally – this is a really good one; it's a very common and useful form – and it uses <strong>would</strong> and <strong>could,</strong> and it can be in either order, so listen to these:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>If you could</em></strong><em> finish it, <strong>that would be</strong> great.</em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><em>It would be</em></strong><em> great <strong>if you could</strong> <strong>finish</strong> it.</em></span></p>\n<p><span>It sounds a bit like a second conditional in terms of its form. Let's remind ourselves of the second conditional. In a second conditional you say <strong>if + past simple,</strong> then<strong> would + infinitive</strong>. So for example:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>If I had</strong> a million dollars, <strong>I would buy</strong> a big house. If I had a million dollars, I would buy a big house.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, coming back to our polite request, here the 'if part' always takes the modal verb <strong>could</strong>: <strong>if you could...</strong> plus an infinitive, as Neil said: <strong>If you could finish the programme…</strong></span></p>\n<p><span> </span><span>And then the result part with <strong>would</strong> – is generally is something like <strong>it would be great</strong>, or <strong>that would be great</strong>, we can use 'it' or 'that'. Or you could say something like <strong>that would be fantastic</strong>, or even <strong>I would appreciate it</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>It's something very positive – if you could do something, that would be great. Or it would be great if you could do something. </span></p>\n<p><span>And now occasionally, people sometimes make this request without the result part. They just say:</span></p>\n<p>So Rob, if you could finish the report… thanks.</p>\n<p><span>There we are – lots of ways to make polite requests! </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Would you mind…?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Are you OK to…?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Is there any chance you could…?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>If you could</strong> <strong>do</strong> something <strong>that would be great.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>It would be great if</strong> <strong>you could do</strong> something.</span></p>\n<p><span>So there we are, five different ways of making polite requests. </span><span>Hope you've enjoyed learning it – and make sure you practise these when you can. </span><span>Let's listen to the whole thing again! Bye.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Morning Rob.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Hi Neil.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>How's that programme coming along? <strong>Would you mind</strong> sending it to me when it's finished?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Yeah sure, I can do that.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So Rob, <strong>is there any chance you could</strong> send me that programme you've been promising me?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>OK. I'll do my best.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So Rob. <strong>Are you OK to</strong> send that programme soon?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Yeah sure.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So Rob, that programme we were talking about earlier. <strong>I'd really appreciate it if you could</strong> send it over to me.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>I'll try.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>So, Rob, <strong>if you could send </strong>me that programme for checking, <strong>that would be</strong> <strong>really great</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Right, I'll do my best.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Have you started it?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Soon, soon.</span></p> </div>",

At over <strong>6,500,000</strong> square miles, it's the largest country in the world. And the total area of cultivated land has been estimated as <strong>a six-figure number</strong>: perhaps <strong>500,000</strong> square miles. Its mountain ranges contain Mount Elbrus, which at <strong>5,642</strong> metres is the highest point in both Russia and Europe. Of its rivers, which are <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>, the River Volga, the longest river in Europe, is the most well known. And what about the people? Well, here’s an interesting fact: the number of languages spoken in Russia is <strong>in triple figures</strong> – yes, over 100!<strong><br/> <br/> </strong><strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So that was Anita. And we asked: How many metres high is Mount Elbrus?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And the answer is <strong>five thousand, six hundred and forty-two metres</strong> high.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Which is a good example of our topic today. When saying a large number, we always begin with the biggest number first. So thousands, then hundreds, then tens. Tens means numbers with two digits in them, like <strong>forty-two</strong>. Listen again.<br/><strong><br/> Finn<br/> </strong><strong>Five thousand, six hundred and forty-two</strong>.<strong><br/> <br/> Callum<br/> </strong>And the other point is, that the number labels are always singular. So <strong>five thousand</strong> and not five thousands.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> Six hundred</strong> and not six hundreds.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Exactly. Now, notice that we don’t connect thousands and hundreds with the word <strong>and</strong>. It’s <strong>five thousand, six hundred</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Not five thousand and six hundred.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>But we do connect hundreds and tens with the word <strong>and.</strong> So <strong>six hundred and forty-two. </strong>And I think it’s time for our first clip.<br/> <br/> <strong>INSERT CLIP 1         <br/> </strong>Russia is a land of superlatives! At over <strong>6,500,000</strong> square miles, it's the largest country in the world. And the total area of cultivated land has been estimated as a <strong>six-figure number</strong>: perhaps 500,000 square miles. <br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we heard <strong>six million, five hundred thousand</strong>. Notice that we don’t connect millions to thousands with the word <strong>and </strong>either, or in this case, millions to hundreds of thousands. We say it like this: <strong>six million, five hundred thousand</strong>.<br/><br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Now, how did Anita describe the figure <strong>500,000</strong>? <br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>She described it as <strong>a six-figure number</strong>. Because it contains six digits. We could also say it’s <strong>a six-digit number</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Yes, we sometimes describe a number in this way to emphasise how big it is. And it doesn’t have to be six. It could be a <strong>five-figure</strong> or a <strong>four-figure</strong> <strong>number</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Now, on to clip 2.<strong><br/> <br/> INSERT CLIP 2<br/> </strong>Of its rivers, which are <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>, the River Volga, the longest river in Europe, is the most well known. And what about the people? Well, here’s an interesting fact: the number of languages spoken in Russia is <strong>in triple figures</strong> – yes, over 100!<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So how did Anita describe the number of rivers in Russia?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>She said they’re <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>When we want to describe approximately what a number is, we can say it’s <strong>in the tens, the hundreds, the thousands</strong> and so on. <strong>Hundreds of thousands</strong> means at least 100,000 and probably a lot more.<strong><br/> <br/> Finn<br/> </strong>So you could even say that a number is <strong>in the tens of millions</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>There was also an interesting fact there about the number of languages spoken in Russia.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Anita said they’re <strong>in triple figures</strong>. That means that the number contains three figures – so at least 100. It’s the same as saying that the number is <strong>in the hundreds</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>IDENT</strong>            <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from bbclearningenglish.com.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And it’s quiz time!

(1,200,464)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t use the word <strong>and</strong> to join millions and thousands or thousands and hundreds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two million, fifty-six thousand, three hundred</strong>. (2,056,300)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But do use the word <strong>and</strong> to join hundreds and tens (tens are two-digit numbers):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fifty-six thousand, three hundred and eleven</strong>. (56,311)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We sometimes emphasise how big a number is by counting the number of digits it has and describing it as <strong>a four-figure/five-figure</strong> or <strong>six-figure number:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m not sure what he earns, but it’s certainly <strong>a six-figure number</strong>. (100,000 - 999,000)</li>\n<li>a <strong>six-figure salary</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To describe approximately what a number is, we can say it’s <strong>in</strong> <strong>the tens/the hundreds/ the thousands/the millions</strong>. For very big numbers a number can be <strong>(in the)</strong> <strong>tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, tens of millions </strong>and so on<strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>They’ve cut<strong> hundreds of thousands </strong>of pounds from the budget.</li>\n<li>Their assets alone must be worth <strong>in the tens of millions</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way of describing a number approximately is to say that it’s<strong> in triple figures (100-999):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of emails waiting for me after my holiday was<strong> in triple figures.</strong></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>One thousand</h3>\n<p>1,000 = <strong>a thousand, </strong><strong>one thousand.</strong></p>\n<p><em>A <strong>millennium</strong> is a period of <strong>a thousand</strong> years.</em></p>\n<p>Is <strong>a thousand</strong> a big number? It probably depends on who you are and what you are talking about. If it's the number of people at your birthday party, it probably is a big number. If it's the number of people who live in a town, it's probably not that big.</p>\n<p>Here are some more facts, expressions and sayings related to the number 1,000.</p>\n<p>In slang, £1,000 or $1,000 is known as <strong>a grand</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I found a bag in the park, it's got about <strong>ten grand</strong> in cash in it.

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>In this programme, we're talking about linking devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right! And there are lots of different kinds of linking devices, but today we're looking at ways of contrasting one idea with another.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, some words and phrases that do this are <strong>however</strong>, <strong>although</strong> and <strong>despite</strong>. We'll give you lots of information and examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And of course there'll be a quiz to see what you've learnt.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, here we go, with our first example sentences from Neil:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. Sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now the ideas in those two sentences contrast with each other a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The fact that they completely disagreed is slightly surprising or unexpected if they were the best of friends, isn't it?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It depends on the friendship but yes, it could be true.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It could be.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And to express this contrast clearly and in an interesting way, we can link the ideas in the sentences with the word <strong>but</strong>, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends, <strong>but</strong> sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or we can use the word <strong>however</strong>, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. <strong>However</strong>, sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, <strong>however </strong>doesn't make two sentences into one long sentence, like the word <strong>but </strong>does.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No, as you heard, <strong>however </strong>usually goes at the start of a new sentence, or, we can sometimes put it at the end of a sentence, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. Sometimes we completely disagreed, <strong>however</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Now if we prefer to join the two sentences together into one longer sentence, we could use <strong>although</strong> or <strong>even though</strong>. And they express surprise more than <strong>however </strong>or<strong> but</strong>. Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Although</strong> Dean and I were the best of friends, sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Good. The phrase <strong>even though</strong> works in exactly the same way. And you can use <strong>although</strong> and <strong>even though</strong> at the beginning or in the middle of this longer sentence:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends, <strong>even though</strong> sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's take a look at <strong>despite</strong> and <strong>in spite of</strong>. They mean the same as each other but do they mean the same as <strong>although</strong> and <strong>even though</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Actually yes, they do. They're also used to link and contrast surprising or unexpected ideas and they can go at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. But the grammar is slightly different. Listen:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Despite</strong> being the best of friends, Dean and I sometimes completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So:<strong> despite </strong>isfollowed by the -ing form of the verb, <strong>despite being</strong>, We don't use a subject and a verb after <strong>despite</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And <strong>in spite of</strong> is the same. We can also use a noun phrase instead of an –ing verb. Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Despite</strong> our great friendship, Dean and I sometimes completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. So the noun phrase after <strong>despite</strong> is <strong>our great friendship</strong>. And one more point about <strong>despite </strong>and <strong>in spite of</strong>. They can both be followed by the phrase <strong>the fact that </strong>plus a subject and a verb. Listen.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>In spite of the fact that</strong> Dean and I were the best of friends, sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. Now we'll finish with two more linking words, <strong>while </strong>and <strong>whereas</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, these are a bit different. <strong>While </strong>and<strong> whereas </strong>are used mainly for contrasting facts. They don't usually express surprise or any other attitude. Examples please, Neil?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Whereas</strong> I studied zoology, Dean studied medieval history.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So that's a fact! And again, these words can go at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. So we could also say:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I studied zoology <strong>while</strong> Dean studied medieval history.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Very good. And now it's quiz time! Number one. Complete this sentence with either a) <strong>although</strong> or b)<strong>despite</strong>. We hardly ever saw our cousins _____ living very near each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>despite </strong>because it's followed by a verb-ing.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Number two. Fill the gap with either a) <strong>despite</strong> or b) <strong>although</strong>. Libraries are being closed _____ many people have protested against the move.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>although</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Number three. Fill the gap with either a) <strong>in spite of</strong> or b) <strong>whereas</strong>. Honey is supposed to be good for you _____ sugar is considered bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's b) <strong>whereas</strong>. Honey is supposed to be good for you <strong>whereas</strong> sugar is considered bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done! Congratulations if you got them right at home <strong>despite the fact that</strong> they were quite difficult!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done indeed.

The conjunction goes before the dependent clause. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Even though</strong> I know it was incredibly risky I went out in the thunderstorm...</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This can also be written as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I went out in the thunderstorm <strong>even though</strong> I know it was incredibly risky.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Although and though</h3>\n<p><strong>Although</strong> and <strong>though</strong> are also used in the same way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>(Al)though</strong> there was lots of lightning I wasn't struck.</em></li>\n<li><em>I wasn't struck <strong>(al)though</strong> there was lots of lightning.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Although </strong>or<strong> though?<br/></strong>These two words are really the same. <strong>T</strong><strong>hough </strong>is a shortened form of <strong>although</strong>. <strong>Although</strong> is perhaps more formal.</p>\n<p><strong>Even though or (al)though?<br/></strong>Both these expressions have the same basic meaning. <strong>Even though</strong> adds more emphasis to the contrast. Note that we <strong>don't</strong> say <strong>even although</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Despite / in spite of </h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Despite </strong>not being hurt my mates were really worried.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>In spite of</strong> the danger I think I'd do it again.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are both prepositional phrases that also highlight a contrast. They have the same meaning as <strong>even though </strong>and<strong> </strong><strong>(al)though </strong>but as they are <strong>prepositions</strong> they <strong>must</strong> be <strong>followed by nouns.</strong><em><br/></em></p>\n<p>Compare these sentences with the same meaning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Even though </strong>I wasn't hurt my mates were really worried</em>. <strong>Correct</strong></li>\n<li><em><strong>Even though</strong> not being hurt my mates were really worried</em>. <strong>Wrong</strong></li>\n<li><em><strong>Despite</strong> not being hurt my mates were really worried</em>. <strong>Correct</strong> ('not being hurt' is a noun phrase including the gerund 'being'. Remember a gerund is noun made from a verb).</li>\n<li><em><strong>Despite</strong> I wasn't hurt my mates were really worried</em>. <strong>Wrong</strong></li>\n<li><em><strong>In spite of</strong> not being hurt my mates were really worried</em>. <strong>Correct</strong> </li>\n<li><em><strong>In spite of</strong> I wasn't hurt my mates were really worried</em>. <strong>Wrong</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is possible to use <strong>despite</strong> or <strong>in spite of</strong> before a pronoun by adding <strong>the fact</strong>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Despite the fact</strong> I wasn't hurt my mates were really worried.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>In spite of the fact</strong> I wasn't hurt my mates were really worried.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p><strong>Even though</strong> we're sure you understand this topic, why not try our quiz to check?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>In the next activity we look at some more contrasting words, <strong>however</strong> and <strong>but</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>However</h3>\n<p>Here are the last few sentences from the story of Ken and the thunderstorm from the previous activity.</p>\n<p><em><strong>In spite of</strong> the danger I think I'd do it again. Next time I won't take an umbrella, <strong>however</strong>. It kept me dry <strong>but</strong> it was not a good idea.</em></p>\n<p><strong>However </strong>is an adverb and it comes after a statement that is going to be contrasted. If you remove <strong>however</strong>, the sentence would still make sense. It's not essential to the meaning. </p>\n<p>Like most adverbs it can come at different places in the sentence and in writing it is <strong>followed by a comma</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>However</strong>, next time I won't take an umbrella.</em></li>\n<li><em>Next time, <strong>however</strong>, I won't take an umbrella.</em></li>\n<li><em>Next time I won't take an umbrella, <strong>however</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>But</h3>\n<p>This conjunction is probably the easiest and most common way to contrast two ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>It kept me dry <strong>but</strong> it was not a good idea.</em></li>\n<li><em>I like it <strong>but</strong> I'm not going to buy it.</em></li>\n<li><em>He told me he loved me <strong>but</strong> I don't believe him.</em></li>\n<li><em>They played really well <strong>but</strong> still lost.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It comes <strong>before</strong> the clause that has the contrast. Unlike <strong>however </strong>it <strong>can't</strong> come at different places in a clause: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>It kept me dry it was not <strong>but</strong> a good idea. </em><strong>Wrong</strong></li>\n<li><em>It kept me dry it was not a good idea <strong>but</strong>.</em> <strong>Wrong</strong></li>\n<li><em>It kept me dry <strong>but</strong> it was not a good idea. </em><strong>Right</strong> </li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Using <em>but</em> and <em>however</em> at the beginning of a sentence</h3>\n<p>Some people believe that it is a mistake to begin a sentence with 'but' or 'however'. But, this isn't correct. There is no grammatical reason why you can't or shouldn't; <strong>however</strong>, if you don't want to use one of these words at the beginning of a sentence, you can <strong>use a semi-colon</strong> before the contrasting clause instead of a full-stop.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>In spite of the danger I think I'd do it again. <strong>However</strong>, next time I won't take an umbrella.</em> <strong>Right</strong></li>\n<li><em>In spite of the danger I think I'd do it again; <strong>however</strong>, next time I won't take an umbrella. </em><strong>Right</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>However: other uses</h3>\n<p>However isn't always used to contrast things. Look at the following examples where <strong>however </strong>is an adjective that means <strong>\"It doesn't matter how ...\" </strong>or <strong>\"No matter how...\"</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>However</strong> hard you try, you won't succeed.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>However</strong> much I get paid, it isn't enough. </em></li>\n<li><em>I don't believe you, <strong>however</strong> many times you tell me it's true. </em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these next examples, however is part of an adverbial phrase which means 'any way'.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You can work it out <strong>however </strong>you want, either in your head or with a calculator.</em></li>\n<li><em>There are lots of different ways to do the same thing in this software, so feel free to do it <strong>however</strong> you want.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>However</strong> you look at it they should have won. They were the better team by far.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>But: other uses</h3>\n<p><strong>But</strong> also has some uses that are not directly related to contrasting ideas. Look at these examples where the meaning is like <strong>except</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I had no choice <strong>but</strong> to do what she said.</em></li>\n<li><em>You can have any one <strong>but</strong> the red ones.</em></li>\n<li><em>He gave me everything <strong>but</strong> his love.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the next example it means <strong>if it were it not for</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I could have been a professional footballer <strong>but</strong> for the fact I had no talent.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>But</strong> for a serious injury he would have played in the final.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you know the difference between <strong>however</strong> and <strong>but</strong>?

Read the article and do some exercises to check how well you understood it.</p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Read this article about famous stories about people who achieved their goals in spite of their difficulties. As you read, look for the answer to this question: <strong>Which famous person in the article is compared to a bird in a well-known children's story?</strong> The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong><span>Part 1</span></strong><br><span>Nobody expected ski jumper Eddie \"the Eagle\" Edwards to become a famous Olympian. But if you ask any British person who he is, they'll recognise the name and smile. Did he win gold at the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988, making his countrymen proud? No, they love him in spite of his finishing a distant last in the competition. Actually, they love him exactly because of that. Edwards was working as a <strong>plasterer</strong> when he qualified. His struggle <strong>captured people's imagination</strong>.<br/><br/>\"I was a normal guy, I just did the best I could with what I had - which wasn't much,\" he said. \"I had no money, no training facilities, no snow, no ski jumps, no trainer but I still managed to ski jump for my country - and getting there was my gold medal.\"<br/></span><strong><br/><span><strong>Part 2</strong><br/></span></strong><span>If Edwards's story sounds like a version of the tale The Hare and The Tortoise, in which the tortoise comes last but still becomes famous, singer Susan Boyle's story is that of the Ugly Duckling. The <strong>unassuming</strong> middle-aged fat lady met a <strong>sceptical</strong> panel of judges and spectators when she said on the stage of a talent competition that she wished to become a professional singer as successful as Elaine Paige – an international singing star. But Boyle turned into a musical swan before everybody's eyes when she started to sing \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from the musical Les Misérables. The woman from Scotland became an <strong>internet sensation</strong> in 2009. Although she didn't look like Taylor Swift, millions of people wanted to watch the video of her audition.<br/></span><strong><br/><strong><span>Part 3</span></strong></strong><br/><span>Susan Boyle is a wealthy artist now, but when we think about an underdog who really earned a lot of money a name which comes to mind is that of the Hungarian-born American businessman and philanthropist George Soros. His is a real <strong>from rags to riches</strong> story. In spite of being born to a Jewish family with a successful business, he ended up as an impoverished student in London. Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Budapest and fled the Communist regime, before working as a waiter and a railway porter while studying at the London School of Economics. And although Soros managed to get a degree, he had difficulty in finding a good job. He tried hard but employers didn't want to give him a chance. </span></br></p>\n<p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">The <strong>breakthrough</strong> came when Soros was accepted at the merchant bank Singer and Friedlander, where the managing director was Hungarian too. George Soros has had his share of controversy – considered a currency <strong>speculator</strong>, his name is linked to the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis. Forbes magazine sees George Soros as a thoroughly <strong>self-made man</strong>.<br/></span><strong><br/><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Part 4</strong><br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">The appeal of those who succeed <strong>against all odds</strong> has been celebrated in literature and movies, with stories based on the struggles of real underdogs. The Pursuit of Happyness took to the screen in 2006 the story of Chris Gardner, a homeless single father who ended up with a good job in the financial sector, wrote a book and now encourages people not to accept defeat. Environmental activist Erin Brockovich's story was also turned into a film in 2000: despite not having studied law, this single mother helped US residents to receive compensation from a big energy company which had polluted the area where they lived. </span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">The underdog also has a guaranteed place in fictional stories. Actor Jonah Hill, known for The Wolf of Wall Street and Moneyball, isn't handsome - but is very much in demand at the moment to play the funny and loveable underdog. He says: \"You don't buy that Brad Pitt is struggling, you know that guy could be the most 'skill-less' guy in the world, but if you look like that you will be fine for the rest of your life.\" <br/>  <br/><strong>Part 5</strong></span><strong><br/></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">One of the most famous real underdogs in the movie industry is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who left his hometown in Austria with ambitious plans. First he came to Britain and then went to the US, and even though he had a surname many people can't pronounce or write correctly and a heavy German accent, he <strong>made it big</strong>. Who wouldn't like to have been <strong>a fly on the wall</strong> when he approached agents in Hollywood, saying that he wanted to be an actor? You might find some clips of his early movies online. His English was not easy to understand. But Arnie didn't seem to have taken \"no\" for an answer, and pushed hard to be a movie star, later becoming the Governor of California. He has been <strong>the butt of jokes </strong>for decades - but this underdog doesn't seem to mind: he came out on top.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">The secret of a successful underdog appears to be their confidence and determination to achieve their objectives, no matter what others say. Maybe the famous line by Arnold Schwarzenegger's robot character in The Terminator is a message to the underdog: \"I'll be back!\" </span></p>\n<p>Do you feel like an underdog? Well, if something doesn't work, don't give up. Come back and <strong>have another go</strong>.  <br/><br/><strong>Answer to our question:<br/></strong>The famous person in the article compared to a bird from a children's story is Scottish singer Susan Boyle. The story is the Ugly Duckling and the bird ends up as a beautiful swan. A happy ending for the bird - and for Susan Boyle!</p>\n<p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>To do</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Here are more questions for you to check how much of the article you can understand.</span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>End of Session 3</strong></h3>\n<p>Was yours a good score? If not, tell yourself 'I'll be back!\" and try again later - we're sure you'll do better next time. Join us in Session 4 when Finn gives us a How to... guide to disagreeing with people.</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Hi, this is Finn. Now, as much as we all like to get along, it's important to know how to disagree in English. So in this programme we're going to tell you how to do it politely – of course - but firmly as well.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, as we'll see, in order to disagree well, you also need to know how to agree! Confusing?</span></p>\n<p><span>Well, let's go straight in and listen to Neil and Rob disagreeing. </span></p>\n<p><span>Neil thinks The Beatles are the best band ever. Rob is not so sure – he thinks their singer Paul McCartney is better than the whole band. Now listen to their conversation. What happens at the end?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>You know Rob, there is absolutely no doubt at all that The Beatles are the best group, the finest group, in the history of popular music.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>I don't accept that Neil. I mean, you know, they've had some hits. But let's take the musicians individually. I mean Paul McCartney is obviously the one who's had the best career. As a solo singer, I think he's done best.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>Well, I mean that's not true really, is it? I mean, John Lennon died so young that you can't really, you can't really compare.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>No, I don't agree. No, definitely Paul McCartney, I mean he's stood the test of time, he writes his own songs.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>See, I understand what you're saying, but even so, there's no way that you can say that Paul McCartney is bigger than The Beatles. The Beatles were, you know, and are, the biggest group.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>I agree with that but I mean Paul McCartney went on to have a very long music career. You know, much longer than The Beatles. He's kind of covered all kinds of genres hasn't he. He's very talented. He's the most talented Beatle, basically. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>Although you're right about that and his solo career being very long, I can't accept that Paul McCartney is more important, or bigger than The Beatles. I'm afraid we're going to have to agree to disagree. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>So, interesting discussion, and at the end they – agreed to disagree. Now that's a really good phrase – to agree to disagree, and it's often used how Neil did it. So, after a long argument nobody has won, you can say - ah well, we'll agree to disagree, or let's agree to disagree. Or, you can use it with have to - we'll just have to agree to disagree.</span></p>\n<p><span>OK, so let's look at other parts of that conversation again. What do they do at the start of each of these points that they make?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>Although you're right about that…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>I agree with that, but…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>I understand what you're saying, but even so…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><br/>So what do they do? They agree with each other! They find something they agree about before moving on to the part they disagree about. Now it's a way of making your disagreement seem less aggressive. Listen again:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>Although you're right about that…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>I agree with that, but…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>I understand what you're saying, but even so…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>But sometimes, you can also use a phrase which shows quite clearly that you don't agree, for example: </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>No, I don't agree…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><br/>I don't agree. That's pretty direct! And if it's what you mean, then just say it! Now, you can also use phrases like these:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong> <span><br/>I don't accept that Neil…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong> <span><br/>Well, I mean that's not true really is it….</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>I don't agree, I don't accept that, that's not true… </span></p>\n<p><span>These are all phrases we can use before we go on to make our own point in the argument. So there we go. I hope you've enjoyed listening to this – and no doubt you're hoping for your next chance to have an argument with someone, just to practise! </span></p>\n<p><span>Anyway, let's listen to the whole thing again. What about you – do you think The Beatles are the best pop band ever? Or do you disagree…? Bye.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>You know Rob, there is absolutely no doubt at all that The Beatles are the best group, the finest group, in the history of popular music.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I don't accept that Neil. I mean, you know, they've had some hits. But let's take the musicians individually. I mean Paul McCartney is obviously the one who's had the best career. As a solo singer, I think he's done best.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Well, I mean that's not true really, is it? I mean, John Lennon died so young that you can't really, you can't really compare.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, I don't agree. No, definitely Paul McCartney, I mean he's stood the test of time, he writes his own songs.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>See, I understand what you're saying, but even so, there's no way that you can say that Paul McCartney is bigger than The Beatles. The Beatles were, you know, and are, the biggest group.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I agree with that but I mean Paul McCartney went on to have a very long music career.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Callum.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And me, Finn. In this programme we’re talking about an interesting type of adjective. <strong><br/><br/>Callum<br/></strong>Yes, they’re adjectives that are formed from the names of famous people such as authors, politicians and scientists. There’ll be lots of examples.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>But first, here’s Ruth. She’s talking about some common adjectives from names that we use.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And listen out for the answer to  this question: Which adjective comes from the name of the author George Orwell? Here’s Ruth.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ruth<br/></strong>Charles Dickens is regarded as the greatest novelist of <strong>Victorian </strong>England and many of his books describe the poverty of that time. So what do we mean by <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions? And what about an <strong>Orwellian</strong> future? Have you read the book <em>1984</em> by the author George Orwell? A <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is clearly the kind of speech made by the politician Winston Churchill. And you can probably guess which famous people these adjectives come from: <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite</strong> outlook on life.</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong><br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>So that was Ruth. And we asked you which adjective comes from the name of the author George Orwell?  <br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>Orwellian</strong>. The suffix <strong>–ian</strong> is often added to the names of famous writers and scientists to form new adjectives.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Now these adjectives describe something that person is famous for. Orwell wrote about a nightmare vision of the future in his book <em>1984</em>, so an <strong>Orwellian </strong>future or society is terrible like the one in the book, with no individual freedom.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And people sometimes say that reality TV programmes are Orwellian because they spy on what people are doing.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And I’ve heard politicians’ views described as Orwellian too.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Listen for more of these adjectives in our first clip.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1         <br/></strong>Charles Dickens is regarded as the greatest novelist of <strong>Victorian </strong>England and many of his books describe the poverty of that time. So what do we mean by <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions?<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now which two adjectives came from the names of famous people in that clip?<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Well, there was <strong>Victorian</strong>. <strong>Victorian</strong> England means England when Queen Victoria ruled, which was from 1837 to 1901.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Other queens and kings whose names are commonly used as adjectives include <strong>Elizabethan</strong>, <strong>Edwardian</strong> and <strong>Georgian.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And with kings and queens it’s always their first names that are made into adjectives, not their surnames. Now that clip also used the adjective <strong>Dickensian</strong>. Ruth asked us what <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions are.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, well, because Charles Dickens wrote a lot about the poverty of Victorian England, <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions are very poor, like those in his novels.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>You could also say that a street or house is <strong>Dickensian</strong>, meaning that it is very old and in poor condition. But onto our second clip.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>A <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is clearly the kind of speech made by the politician Winston Churchill. And you can probably guess which famous people these adjectives come from: <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite</strong> outlook on life.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>A <strong>Churchillian </strong>speech. Now Churchill is famous for being a powerful, determined politician and a brilliant speaker.<strong><br/><br/>Callum<br/></strong>So, a <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is a powerful and brilliant speech. And we also heard <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite </strong>outlook on life.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. <strong>Freudian </strong>from Freud, the psychologist. Freud wrote a lot about the unconscious mind. And <strong>a Freudian slip</strong> is a fixed phrase that means a mistake that you make, especially when speaking, caused by the thoughts in your unconscious mind. <br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/>Thatcherite</strong> comes from Margaret Thatcher, who was a Prime Minister of the UK. Adjectives from politicians’ names are often formed with the suffixes <strong>–ist</strong> and <strong>–ite</strong>. Other examples are <strong>Stalinist </strong>from the Soviet leader Josef Stalin,<strong> Maoist </strong>from the Chinese Chairman Mao and <strong>Reaganite </strong>from former US President Reagan.<br/><br/><strong>IDENT</strong>            <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from bbclearningenglish.com.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>And we’re talking about adjectives that are formed from names.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And it’s quiz time! Ready? Number one: Which of these nouns goes best with the adjective Orwellian? a) an Orwellian society b) Orwellian freedom.<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>The answer’s a) an Orwellian society.<br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Good. Number two: Are Dickensian conditions a) the conditions in which Charles Dickens lived, or b) any poor social living conditions?<br/><br/><strong>Callum</strong><br/>It’s b) any poor living conditions.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done! Number three: Tony Blair was a Prime Minister of the UK and the adjective from his name is like that of Margaret Thatcher. So would we talk about a) Blairist policies or b) Blairite policies?<br/><br/><strong>Callum<br/></strong>The answer’s b) Blairite.<br/><br/><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And that’s the end of the quiz.

There are some common <strong>eponymous adjectives</strong> that you might not realise come from names because those names are from a long time ago in history or literature.</p>\n<p>Of course, you could work out the origin of this one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>His life was a <strong>Shakespearean</strong> tragedy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The name there is Shakespeare, the English playwright from the <strong>Elizabethan</strong> period.</p>\n<p>That was an easy one, but do you know the names behind these adjectives? And what about the meanings?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>herculean</strong></li>\n<li><strong>chauvinistic</strong></li>\n<li><strong>mercurial</strong></li>\n<li><strong>narcissistic</strong></li>\n<li><strong>platonic</strong></li>\n<li><strong>martial</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See how much you know below!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Where do they come from and what do they mean?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Herculean</strong>:<strong> </strong>from <strong>Hercules</strong>, the mythical character from Greek and Roman mythology. Hercules had great strength and that is the quality in the eponymous adjective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bringing up a family all by yourself is a <strong>herculean</strong> task.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br>Chauvinistic</br></strong>: from Nicholas <strong>Chauvin</strong>, an extremely patriotic, possibly fictional, French soldier from <strong>Napoleonic</strong> times. The adjective now refers mostly to men who have a prejudiced attitude towards women.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He's so <strong>chauvinistic</strong>. hH never lets his wife drive. He says women can't drive and should stay in the kitchen. What an idiot!</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><br/></em><strong>Mercurial</strong>: from <strong>Mercury</strong>, the Roman god. Today's meaning refers to someone or something that is unpredictable and often changing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He's a mercurial talent, which makes him very difficult to work with.<br/><br/></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Narcissistic</strong>: from <strong>Narcissus</strong>, a character from Greek mythology who was so in love with his own reflection in a pool that he drowned. Today it refers to people who are obessed with themselves and their physical appearance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em> I can't believe how <strong>narcissitic</strong> he is. He spends hours in the gym, not working out but mostly looking at himself in the mirrors.<br/><br/></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Platonic</strong>: From <strong>Plato </strong>the Greek philosopher. He wrote about many things including the idea of a love between people that was not romantic or physical. This is close to today's meaning where it usually refers to close friendships that are not sexual.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>We have a purely <strong>platonic</strong> friendship. She's someone I can really talk to and I wouldn't want to ruin it by getting involved intimately.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><br/></em><strong>Martial</strong>: from <strong>Mars</strong>, the Roman god of war. We use this adjective today to mean something relating to war and fighting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I took up <strong>martial</strong> arts when I was a teenager and got into the national team a few years later.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the quiz see if you can choose the right adjective for each situation.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. In the next activity, you'll learn some adjectives which come form artists' names.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>-esque</h3>\n<p>The suffix <strong>-esque</strong> is another one that is used in eponymous adjectives. It's simply added to the end of the name.</p>\n<p>These examples all come from the arts. Do you who they refer to?</p>\n<p><strong>Daliesque<br/></strong>In the style of Salvador Dali, the Spanish surrealist painter.</p>\n<p><strong>Capraesque<br/></strong>In the style of Frank Capra, the Italian-American film director.</p>\n<p><strong>Rubenesque<br/></strong>In the style of Peter Paul Rubens, the Flemish painter.</p>\n<p><strong>Dylanesque<br/></strong>In the style of Bob Dylan, the musician from the US.</p>\n<p><strong>Kafkaesque<br/></strong>In the style of Franz Kafka, the writer. Also used to describe a nightmarish situation with complex bureaucracy and a feeling of oppression.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived at the airport they arrested me, a case of mistaken identity. When they finally realised their mistake they let me go but then arrested me again because my visa had run out. It had only run out because they had kept me in jail! What a Kafkaesque nightmare.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pythonesque<br/></strong>In the style of Monty Python, the British comedy group.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Not just for eponymous adjectives</h3>\n<p>There are a few common adjectives ending in <strong>-esque</strong> that are not eponymous. </p>\n<p><strong>picturesque - </strong>a place that is attractive and charming</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>There are hundreds of <strong>picturesque</strong> villages in rural France.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>statuesque - </strong>a description of someone tall, dignified and graceful: usually used about a woman.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The princess looked <strong>statuesque</strong> in her stunning dress.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>grotesque - </strong>looking<strong> </strong>disgusting and ugly or shockingly inappropriate</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>At Halloween he went out in a <strong>grotesque</strong> mask that was really scary. </em></li>\n<li><em>When he was chairman of the company he earnt a <strong>grotesque</strong> amount of money.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Can you use these <strong>-esque</strong> words the correct way?

Now, we usually use the future perfect to talk about an event that we predict or expect to happen or finish before a particular time in the future. Listen to this example from Feifei.<br/> <strong><br/> Feifei<br/> </strong>By the time Christine arrives, <strong>we’ll have had</strong> dinner.<br/> <strong><br/> Callum<br/> </strong>So <strong>we’ll have had, </strong>that’s<strong> we will have had - </strong>in the future perfect tells us that we will finish dinner before Christine gets back. We might be having dinner right up to just before she returns or we might finish it an hour before …<br/>   <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>… but in any case, we will finish <strong>before</strong> she arrives. <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>We are using the future perfect to make a prediction about the future. Here are some more examples.<br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> </strong>This time next year, <strong>I will have finished</strong> my course.<br/> Sales <strong>will have increased</strong> by 20 per cent by next January.<br/> By 2020 the city’s population <strong>will have doubled</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Now we usually use a time phrase with the future perfect, often with <strong>by</strong> or <strong>in</strong>. Let’s hear examples with <strong>by</strong> again:<br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> </strong>Sales will have increased by 20 per cent <strong>by next January</strong>.<br/> <strong>By 2020</strong> the city’s population will have doubled.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And here are some more examples with a <strong>by</strong> time phrase. <br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> By the summer</strong> I’ll have finished all my exams.<br/> We’ll have moved house <strong>by Christmas</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So we had <strong>by next January, by 2020,</strong> <strong>by the summer</strong> and <strong>by Christmas</strong>. We can also say <strong>by the winter… by the end of the week…<br/> </strong><br/> <strong>Finn<br/> …by next month </strong>or<strong> next year… by this time next week…  <br/> </strong><br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>In fact you can pretty well use <strong>by…</strong> with any future date, month, season or special day.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Very special day. Another time expression with <strong>by</strong> we can use with the future perfect is <strong>by the time that…</strong>plus a subject and verb. Listen to the example we had earlier, and check out the tense.<br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> </strong>By the time Christine arrives, we’ll have had dinner.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>It’s the present simple - <strong>arrives. </strong><br/> <br/>  <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>When we use <strong>in</strong> for a time phrase with the future perfect, we can use it with a day, a month, a date, a time period. Here are some examples.<strong><br/> </strong><br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> In fifty years' time</strong>, sea levels will have risen by several centimetres.<br/> <strong>In June</strong> I’ll have been unemployed for five months.<br/> <strong>In 2050</strong>, I believe robots will have replaced sales assistants in shops.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>As well as for future plans and predictions, we can also use the future perfect to talk about what we believe or imagine has or hasn’t happened at the moment of speaking…<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>…or in other words, to make educated guesses in the present about the past. Here are some examples.<br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> </strong>There’s no point in calling Judy. <strong>She’ll have left </strong>by now.<br/> Let’s hurry! The film <strong>won’t have started</strong> yet.<br/> If he’s on schedule, Tom <strong>will have arrived in Bangkok </strong>yesterday.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So we assume that Judy has already left….<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And the film hasn’t started..  <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> And Tom has arrived in Bangkok. <br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Now, to form the future perfect we use <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> won’t </strong>plus <strong>have </strong>and the <strong>past participle </strong>of the main verb. <br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> </strong>By the summer <strong>I’ll have finished</strong> all my exams.<br/> The film <strong>won’t have started</strong> yet.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Notice that we usually use short forms, so it’s <strong>I’ll</strong>, <strong>he’ll</strong>, <strong>they’ll</strong> and so on; and <strong>will not</strong> becomes <strong>won’t</strong>. <br/> <strong><br/> Callum<br/> </strong>For questions, it’s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won’t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>have</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Feifei<br/> Will you have finished</strong> reading all the reports by this afternoon?<br/> <strong><br/> IDENT<br/> </strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn <br/> </strong>We're talking about the future perfect verb form. <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So, to recap, we use the future perfect to predict events that will have happened before a particular time in the future…<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>…and to make educated guesses about things happening around now and even in the past. <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And we usually use short forms.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So, it’s time for our quiz. Which is correct? Number one. a) By 2060, scientists will have found a cure for cancer. b) By 2060, scientists will found a cure for cancer. <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> It’s a) By 2060, scientists will have found a cure for cancer.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>I hope so, now number 2. a) Jackie won’t have woken up yet. It’s too early. b) Jackie won’t have wake up yet. It’s too early.<br/>  <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>It’s a) Jackie won’t have woken up yet. It’s too early.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Finally, number three. a) Will have you done all your work by two? b) Will you have done all your work by two?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> And the answer is b) Will you have done all your work by two?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>That’s correct and it’s the end of the show.

Read what she has written and answer this question:</p>\n<p>Why doesn't she know where Michal is?</p>\n<p><em>\"Michal is a traveller, not a tourist. He loves exploring new places and getting to know the locals. By the time he gets back in three months' time he will have been away for nearly a year. He doesn't really do social media: he prefers old-fashioned postcards and letters and what he calls 'proper' photographs. He's terrible at keeping in touch, so I don't know where he is at the moment, but he did let me know his travel plans before he left and he usually sticks to them. By now he'll have visited at least a dozen countries. He'll have crossed deserts and mountains and if he is following his schedule he'll have flown into Borneo last week.\"</em></p>\n<p>She doesn't know where Michal is because he is<em> \"terrible at keeping in touch.\" </em>He also<em> \"doesn't really do social media.\"</em></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at the tenses Susan used. Read the passage again, and find all the examples of the <strong>future perfect</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Future for the past?</h3>\n<p>There are four examples of the <strong>future perfect</strong> in the passage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>...in three months' time he <strong>will have been</strong> away for nearly a year.</em></li>\n<li><em>By now he<strong>'ll have visited</strong> at least a dozen countries.</em></li>\n<li><em>He<strong>'ll have crossed</strong> deserts and mountains...</em></li>\n<li><em>...he<strong>'ll have flown</strong> into Borneo last week.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>How many of these examples of the <strong>future perfect</strong> refer to future time? Only one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>...in three months' time he will have been away for nearly a year.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know this is about a future time because of the time phrase: <strong>in three months' time.</strong></p>\n<p>In the other examples the time expressions refer to the present and past:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>By now</strong> he'll have visited at least a dozen countries.<br/></em>This refers to present time.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><em>...he'll have flown into Borneo <strong>last</strong> <strong>week</strong>.<br/></em>This refers to past time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, using the future perfect does not always mean we are talking about future time. We also use it to make a good guess about an activity <strong>we assume, but don't know for sure</strong>, happened in the past, at or before a particular time. We can make a good guess about it because we know the people and/or their plans.</p>\n<p>Susan <strong>doesn't know for sure</strong> where Michal is, because he is terrible at keeping in touch. But she does know that he usually sticks to his travel plans - and she knows those plans. With that knowledge, <strong>she can make a good guess</strong> about what<strong> he will have done </strong>and where<strong> he will have gone </strong>even it is in the past. </p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Decide whether the sentences are correct or not.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to listen to 6 Minute Grammar.

What about a one-way ticket to the red planet – with no chance of ever coming home? In this session you're going to read about a project that aims to start the first human <strong>colony</strong> on Mars. And just for you, there will be plenty of examples of the future perfect to test you, along with other future forms for revision. Get ready to take one giant step into the future (perfect!)</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the article. As you read, try to answer this question: When will the first humans arrive on Mars?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Article</h3>\n<p><strong>Part One<br/></strong>How would you feel about <strong>living out</strong> the rest of your life on the planet Mars? After all, it's a mere 140 million miles away and has lots of beautiful red dust to enjoy. What's more, scientists' recent discovery of running water there means you wouldn't even have to <strong>go thirsty</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, you're tempted? The thing is, if you fancy a future on the red planet, you're not alone. When the Mars One project asked for volunteers to make a one-way trip with them, over 200,000 people applied.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Two<br/></strong>Mars One? It's an organisation with the goal of creating a \"permanent human <strong>settlement</strong>\" on Mars. The Dutch not-for-profit <strong>body</strong> believes that establishing a colony on the planet is the \"next giant leap for mankind\", and that it will help us understand <strong>the solar system</strong> and inspire generations to come.</p>\n<p>Their ambitious project has attracted both worldwide attention and heavy criticism. Scientists have questioned the technical <strong>feasibility</strong> and large questions remain about the <strong>ethics</strong> and funding of the project. But Mars One are <strong>adamant</strong> they can overcome all the obstacles in their way.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Three<br/></strong>So, what about those 200,000 applicants? Well, that number has now been <strong>whittled down to</strong> 100, and this in turn will be reduced to 24 after a <strong>stringent</strong> selection process. This will involve filmed interviews, group activities and a survival challenge in a <strong>mocked-up Martian</strong> environment, before successful candidates train for the mission itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Four<br/></strong>So what's the plan? And what's the timeline? According to Mars One's website, if everything goes <strong>according to the script</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By 2016 they will have selected final crew and training for the mission can begin. Mars One says this will not only test the group's ability to \"deal with <strong>prolonged</strong> periods of time in a remote location\" but also it will teach them medical procedures and enable them to grow their own food.</li>\n<li>Between 2020-2025, <strong>unmanned</strong> spacecraft will land on Mars and prepare a base for the human crew. A <strong>rover</strong> will scout the planet for a suitable home. And life support units will create an atmosphere suitable for life. By the time the first crew set off, this technology \"will have produced a <strong>breathable</strong> atmosphere of 0.7 bar pressure, 3000 litres of water, and 240 kg of oxygen.\"</li>\n<li>This first group of 12 astronauts will themselves have completed training by 2026, and will make the journey to Mars that year, landing in 2027.</li>\n<li>A second group of 12 is scheduled to depart in 2028.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part Five<br/></strong>Time will tell if the project will be a success. But for R. Daniel Golden and Yari Rodriguez, a trip to Mars might even be a romantic destination. In an interview with American broadcaster WGBH, the couple revealed that they had both been selected among the final 100 applicants, and they hoped they could <strong>make the cut</strong> and continue their life together as astronauts on Mars. If that happens, could we even see the first ever 'Martian' baby?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The first humans will arrive on Mars in 2027, if the project goes to plan.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now, try to answer these questions which test your understanding of the article and of this unit's grammar.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed reading about this project. Do you think it could be successful? And would you like to visit Mars?</p>\n<p>In Session 4 we continue to practise the future perfect tense - by going out onto the streets of London and asking people about their future plans. Hear some authentic English and improve your grammar!</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Callum<br> </br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And me Finn. Today we’re talking about words like Hoover and Xerox, which started as brand names of particular products, but now are often used to refer to other similar products.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And some of them are also used as verbs. Words like these are called eponyms.<strong><br/> <br/> Finn<br/> </strong>There will be a quiz; and of course we’ll bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.<strong><br/> <br/> Callum<br/> </strong>But first let’s listen to Cath. She’s chatting a bit about brand names that have become part of the language.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And listen out for the answer to this question: how does Cath say <strong>do you use Facebook</strong>?<br/> <br/> <strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Cath<br/></strong>‘I’ll <strong>google</strong> it.’ How many times a day do you think or say that? <strong>Google</strong> is the number one search engine today and people sometimes talk about <strong>googling</strong> even when they’re using a different search engine, like Bing or Yahoo. In the same way <strong>Facebook</strong> is number one for social networking and <strong>Skype</strong> for web chats. So do you <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>skype</strong> your friends? And how often do you <strong>xerox</strong> a document or go <strong>rollerblading</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Callum<br/></strong>Right, that was Cath. And we asked: how does she say <strong>do you use Facebook</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And the answer is she said<strong> ‘do you facebook your friends?’</strong><br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>That’s right.  Cath uses <strong>facebook</strong> as a verb because <strong>Facebook</strong> has become so much a part of our lives that we need a verb to talk about using it.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So that’s a bit like using the word <strong>Hoover</strong>, isn’t it?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Exactly. Until the middle of the twentieth century, the <strong>Hoover</strong> brand was the biggest name among vacuum cleaners. That’s why we say that we <strong>hoover</strong> our carpets.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>But today that means ‘use any vacuum cleaner’, doesn’t it? Not just the <strong>Hoover</strong> brand.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>It does. So in fact that’s a bit different from the verb to <strong>facebook</strong>. Because that only means to use the <strong>Facebook</strong> site. But who knows? It might change and be used more generally in the future to refer to other social media sites. Now let’s have our first clip?<br/> <br/> <strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1         <br/> </strong>‘I’ll <strong>google</strong> it.’ How many times a day do you think or say that? <strong>Google</strong> is the number one search engine today and people sometimes talk about <strong>googling</strong> even when they’re using a different search engine like Bing or Yahoo.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So, that’s another example, a bit like <strong>Hoover</strong>. There’s the verb to <strong>google</strong>, the brand name <strong>Google</strong>, and the noun <strong>googling</strong> to talk about the activity of using <strong>Google</strong>.<strong><br/> <br/> Callum<br/> </strong>Yes, and like <strong>hoover </strong>and<strong> hoovering </strong>are good for other vacuum cleaner brands, people can be using any search engine when they use the verb <strong>google</strong> and the noun <strong>googling</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Now, one thing to remember is that trademark names like <strong>Google, Facebook</strong> and <strong>Hoover</strong> should have a capital letter. But the verbs and nouns that come from these names don’t.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Mmm. On to clip 2.<strong><br/> <br/> INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>In the same way <strong>Facebook</strong> is number one for social networking and <strong>Skype</strong> for web chats. So do you <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>skype</strong> your friends? And how often do you <strong>xerox</strong> a document or go <strong>rollerblading</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong> <br/> </strong><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So, Callum, what do we do when we use <strong>Skype</strong>?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Well, we <strong>skype</strong>!<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>We do. <strong>Skyping</strong> is a popular way to contact friends and business colleagues around the world. And this software has given up this new verb, <strong>to skype.</strong> And then Cath threw in another couple of examples with this type of word, didn’t she?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Yes, she talked about <strong>xeroxing</strong> a document. <strong>Xerox </strong>is often used to mean <strong>photocopy</strong>, both noun and verb, and it comes from the company <strong>Xerox</strong>, which produced the first plain paper photocopier.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>But we should mention that this is an American English expression. It’s not one we use very often in British English.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>She also mentioned going <strong>rollerblading</strong>. <strong>Rollerblade</strong> is a brand of inline skates that became so popular that we now have the verb to <strong>rollerblade</strong> and the noun <strong>rollerblading</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And today they’re used whatever brand of inline skates we’re using.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/></strong>Other common words like these are <strong>Kleenex</strong> meaning any kind of paper tissue and <strong>Aspirin</strong> for painkillers. But they don’t have verbs to go with them.</p>\n<p><br/> <strong>IDENT</strong>            <br/> You’re listening to BBC Learning English.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And we’re talking about eponyms as nouns and verbs.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And time for the quiz! Number one: How else can I say <strong>do the vacuuming</strong>?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>It’s <strong>do the hoovering</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn</strong><br/> It is! Number two: What’s another way of saying: <strong>I often talk to my friends on Skype</strong>?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>It’s <strong>I often skype my friends</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Excellent! Number three: What does: <strong>Would you like a Kleenex</strong> mean?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>It means: <strong>Would you like a tissue</strong>?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>That's correct! And that’s the end of the quiz. <strong>Facebook</strong> your friends if you got them all right!<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>But before we go, here’s today’s top tip.  If the name of an object has a capital letter, it’s probably because it’s an eponym from a brand. Look it up in a dictionary, where it should be labelled ‘trademark’, and check whether there are useful verbs or nouns that come from it. Practise making new sentences with those words.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>There’s more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

I usually do <strong>the hoovering</strong> on Saturday mornings. When I'm <strong>hoovering</strong> I listen to BBC Learning English podcasts on my <strong>ipod</strong>.\"</em></p>\n<p>In 6 Minute Vocabulary you heard Finn and Callum talking about some verbs and nouns that come from the name of commercial products.</p>\n<p>These are sometimes known as <strong>proprietary eponyms</strong>. They include current products whose names are used generically to refer to similar items. <strong>Hoover </strong>is one of these. </p>\n<p>Hoover was such a dominant brand of vacuum cleaner in the UK that the name of the brand became associated with all such machines. Even though Hoover is no longer the most popular brand the verb and noun are still commonly used for vacuum cleaners and the act of vacuum cleaning. Some other examples of nouns like this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ipod - </strong>generic term for mp3 player</li>\n<li><strong>walkman - </strong>generic<strong> </strong>term for portable music players</li>\n<li><strong>post-it notes</strong> - generic name for sticky notes</li>\n<li><strong>frisbee </strong>- generic name for flying disc toys</li>\n<li><strong>coke </strong>- generic name for cola-based fizzy drink</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Popularity is not always a good thing</h3>\n<p>For some companies, having their trademark become a generic verb or noun is good for business. It increases public awareness and sales.</p>\n<p>For others it's not so good. The use can be so generic that they can't protect their trademark.</p>\n<p>An example of this is <strong>aspirin</strong>. Today this is a generic term for a kind of painkiller but it used to be a trademark belonging to the German pharmaceutical company, Bayer.</p>\n<p>That same company also produced and sold another drug that they later lost the trademark for. That drug was <strong>heroin</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some other products that used to be trademarks but are now generic are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>granola</strong> - a kind of cereal</li>\n<li><strong>tabloid </strong>- a newspaper format</li>\n<li><strong>cellophane</strong> - a thin clear material used for plastic bags</li>\n<li><strong>bra(ssiere)</strong> - an item of women's clothing </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In the exercise you will see more examples of brands and trademarks used in a generic way. If you don't know the answers, you could always try <strong>googling </strong>them!</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>In the next activity we take a look at the grammar of the vocabulary of social media and the internet.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What or who is a computer?</h3>\n<p>If you were born at the end of the 20th Century you probably <strong>take</strong> personal computers <strong>for granted</strong>. Those who are older might remember the 1980s and 1990s as a time when computers became more affordable and it was possible to have one in the home. Now the smart phones we carry around in our pockets have the same amount of computing power that not so long ago would have filled a room.</p>\n<p>The definition of <strong>computer</strong> used to refer to a job that a person did. A<strong> computer</strong> was someone who did calculations. Now the definition refers to the machine.</p>\n<p>It's an example of how technology is changing language as well as our lives. And it's changing fast. New words for new ideas and software are coming and going from the language.</p>\n<p>When the internet was <strong>in its infancy</strong> it was frequently referred to as <strong>the information superhighway</strong>. That's not a phrase you hear much these days.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Social media</h3>\n<p>No one is quite sure who <strong>coined</strong> the term <strong>social media </strong>back in the 1990s but it was only in the early <strong>noughties</strong> that it took on the importance it has today.</p>\n<p>Social networks like <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter </strong>have their own vocabulary and grammar.</p>\n<p>For example, you write a <strong>post </strong>on Facebook<strong> </strong>but on Twitter it's a <strong>tweet</strong>. To Facebook is a verb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"I'm going to facebook that!\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But<strong> to Twitter </strong>doesn't work as a verb. You use <strong>to tweet</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> are two of the biggest social networks in the world, but their names and their grammatical variants are only associated with their products. However, there is one internet presence that has become as successful as <strong>Hoover </strong>was in dominating the language used to describe what it does. </p>\n<p><strong>Google </strong>dominates the language of searching on the internet. There are other <strong>search engines</strong> but the act of searching is now often referred to as <strong>googling</strong>, whichever tool is being used.</p>\n<p><strong>To google</strong> is a regular verb and it's transitive. You <strong>google</strong> <strong>something</strong> or <strong>someone</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If you don't know the answer, <strong>google it</strong>.</em></li>\n<li><em>I <strong>googled</strong> <strong>my new boss</strong> and found out where he used to work.</em></li>\n<li><em>It's scary what you can find if you <strong>google yourself</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In certain uses it can be intransitive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I hate <strong>googling</strong>. I prefer looking things up in real books.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can be made into an adjective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Look it up, I'm sure it's <strong>googleable</strong>.</em></li>\n<li><em>A recent law means some web pages have to be made <strong>ungoogleable</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Can you use the vocabulary on this page correctly? Find out by trying the quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of session</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this vocabulary session. If you liked it, why not <strong>facebook</strong> it or <strong>tweet</strong> about it?</p></div>",

Before we start though Callum, are you all right?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>What do you mean?<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Well you’ve got little bits of tissue stuck on your face.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Oh that, you noticed.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Well, it’s hard to miss them really.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>I cut myself <strong>shaving</strong>.<strong><br/> <br/> Catherine<br/> </strong>I see, that’s convenient.<strong><br/> <br/> Callum<br/> </strong>Not really, it hurt.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>But it did give you a perfect example of <strong>a present participle clause</strong>, which is today’s topic.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Yes it did! Let’s use that then as our first example. I cut myself <strong>shaving</strong>. First though, let’s remind everyone what a present participle is:<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Sure. The present participle is <strong>the -ing form</strong> of the verb. We use it to form the continuous verb forms. So if the infinitive is shave, the <strong>present participle</strong> is <strong>shaving</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>The past continuous of shave is: “I was <strong>shaving</strong>.”<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And something happened while you were <strong>shaving</strong>, Callum<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> Yes, I cut myself. <br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>You did. Now we can make a number of different sentences with this information. You could say:<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>I was <strong>shaving</strong> and I cut myself or: While I was <strong>shaving</strong> I cut myself.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine <br/> </strong>Let’s just swap those clauses around<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>I cut myself while I was <strong>shaving</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>OK, now because the subject of each of those clauses is the same - you - we can make the sentence more efficient and sound more natural by not repeating the pronoun and auxiliary that goes with it.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>I cut myself while <strong>shaving</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>This is fine, but we can also leave out the conjunction – while. Which leaves us with:<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> I cut myself <strong>shaving</strong>.  <br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>So we can use this structure when two things happen at the same time.<br/>  <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Yes, lets have some more examples. Catherine, what were you doing last night?<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>I was <strong>sitting</strong> on the sofa. I was <strong>watching</strong> TV. So I can say: I was <strong>sitting</strong> on the sofa <strong>watching</strong> TV. Callum: What are we doing now?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> We are in the studio. We are <strong>recording</strong> 6 Minute Grammar. We’re in the studio <strong>recording</strong> 6 Minute Grammar.<br/> <br/> <strong>STING<br/> <br/> Catherine<br/> </strong>Today we’re talking about <strong>participle clauses</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>We’ve looked at one way you can use a <strong>present participle clause;</strong> now let’s look at a <strong>past participle clause</strong>. First Catherine, let’s review what <strong>a past participle</strong> is.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine</strong><br/> It’s the third form of the verb, so if you remember go, went, gone, or do, did, done; gone and done are the <strong>past participles</strong>. For regular verbs this is <strong>the -ed form</strong>. We use the <strong>past participle</strong> in perfect verb forms and also the passive. <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So how would we use a <strong>past participle clause</strong>?<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Like <strong>present participle clauses,</strong> it’s a way of being more economical with language and avoiding repetition. Listen to these sentences. <br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> The dog was <strong>hit</strong> by the car. It wasn’t hurt.<br/> The dog that was <strong>hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br/> The dog <strong>hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br/> <strong><br/> Catherine<br/> </strong>So we started there with two sentences. Both contained clauses that had the same subject. We have <strong>the dog </strong>in the first sentence, and in the second it’s referred to with the pronoun <strong>it.<br/> <br/> Neil<br/> </strong>The dog <strong>was hit</strong> by a car. <strong>It</strong> wasn’t hurt.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine</strong><br/> We can the combine these into one sentence by using a relative clause.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>The dog<strong> that was hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And we can further shorten this by leaving out the relative pronoun and the auxiliary that goes with it. This leaves us with:<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>The dog <strong>hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>So effectively what we do is combine all the bits that identify the subject into one phrase.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Yes, it’s <strong>like a reduced relative clause</strong> that becomes the subject of the sentence. You can see this form quite regularly in warning notices in public places.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Cars <strong>parked</strong> here will be clamped.<br/> Bicycles <strong>chained</strong> to this fence will be removed.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine</strong><br/> Cars <strong>parked</strong> here is a shortened version of: Cars <strong>which are parked</strong> here…<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And bicycles <strong>chained</strong> here is a shortened version of: Bicycles<strong> which are chained </strong>here.<strong><br/> <br/> Catherine<br/> </strong>That’s right.<br/> <br/> <strong>STING<br/> <br/> Callum<br/> </strong>And now: quiz time. Join the two sentences together into one. Here’s number one:<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>I saw the cat. It was playing with a mouse.<br/> I saw the cat. It was playing with a mouse.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And the answer is: I saw the cat playing with a mouse. Number two:<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>The gold was stolen from the bank. It was never found.<br/> The gold was stolen from the bank. It was never found.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>The answer is: The gold stolen from the bank was never found. And finally number three.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>She made a lot of money. She was running her own company.<br/> She made a lot of money. She was running her own company.<strong><br/> <br/> Callum<br/> </strong>And the answer is: She made a lot of money running her own company. Well done if you got them all right.<br/> <br/> <strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And that’s all from us for this programme. There’s more about this topic on our website. <br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Do join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.<br/> <br/> <strong>Both<br/> </strong>Bye</br></p> </div>",

Here in Britain there are plenty and they say a lot about the British way of life. And lucky for you, sometimes they even include examples of <strong>participle clauses</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>To do</strong></p>\n<p>Read BBC Learning English producer Grace's article about public notices. She's from Brazil, so many British signs seemed strange to her at first. As you read, look for the answer to this question: <strong>Where can you find a sign that sounds especially 'dull'?</strong> The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><span><span><strong>Part 1</strong><br>You're never alone in Britain – the streets talk to you. They're a bit like a mother. I live in London now. But as a new visitor I noticed lots of signs, guiding my <strong>tentative</strong> steps on my first<strong> ventures</strong> into town – watching over me as I crossed the street safely. \"Look left\", \"Look right\", \"Crossing not in use\". They <strong>came in handy</strong> for people like me who weren't used to cars driving on the left – I'm part of the 65% of the world population who come from a country with right-hand traffic. They say that before the industrial <strong>era</strong>, horses kept to the left so riders could draw their swords. Now drivers just raise an angry eyebrow if you <strong>dash</strong> into the traffic.</br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>As you get to know more about British life and the routines of this wonderful city, you start to notice a change in the advice given. Signs which you only half-noticed before suddenly seem to be directed at you. \"Bicycles attached to these railings will be removed\", \"No parking in front of these gates\", \"Private property – <strong>trespassers</strong> will be prosecuted\", \"Smoking area - please keep this area tidy and <strong>discard</strong> cigarette ends in bins provided\". The guiding tone has become more of a warning – could this be the \"<strong>adolescence</strong>\" of your life in the city? You're no longer a baby with a guiding mother. Just don't <strong>step out of line</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>The variety of public notices doesn't stop outdoors. And this being Britain, you'll find politeness everywhere. Go into a pub and there's a message from the manager: \"Please do not ask for <strong>credit</strong> as refusal often <strong>offends</strong>\". Well, this makes you check your wallet straight away. Go to the toilet after a few beers and... another warning: \"Polite notice: keep the toilet clean\". It's difficult to avoid the image of your angry mother with one hand on her waist, waiting to strike if you make the wrong move. In my experience, when someone highlights the fact that they are being polite it means they are seconds away from rage. Remember:<strong> toe the line</strong>!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>People enjoy sharing funny signs on the internet. 'Boring' is the name of a community in Oregon, US. It's named after William H. Boring, who began farming there in the 1870s. But it would be hard not to laugh when you pass a road sign saying \"Boring – Oregon City – Exit 1 Mile\". Maybe Boring is actually a really exciting place and you'd be missing out by not going there?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Name coincidences apart, signs can say a lot about people's lives in a particular area at a particular time. A sign I saw a few years ago at Kabul's international airport had a picture of heavy weapons, warning that they were not allowed into the country. In Mexico, a public notice telling me what to do in the case of earthquake sent shivers down my spine. A big billboard in Angola's capital, Luanda, banned street vendors from the area and mentioned severe penalties. It was surrounded by… busy street vendors. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 5</strong><br/>Public notices have an important role in society. They're often an essential part of 'Health and Safety' regulations. Sometimes they <strong>state the obvious</strong>, but nobody wants to be <strong>prosecuted</strong> if someone gets hurt. \"Warning – authorised personnel only\", and \"Persons entering these <strong>premises</strong> must <strong>comply with</strong> all safety regulations\", say notices at a building site near where I live.  </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>We're <strong>bombarded</strong> by messages all the time and sometimes we miss a few. Are we really paying attention to all these signs? To make sure we still <strong>heed</strong> them, a few years ago authorities in Middlesbrough, in north of England, did an experiment by installing <strong>CCTV</strong> cameras and loudspeakers beside public notices. If you didn't respect the \"Don't throw litter\" sign, a voice from the loudspeaker would say: \"Please pick up your rubbish!\" It would even tell you where the nearest bin was. And this being Britain, the voice would also say afterwards: \"Thank you for using the bin\". </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>I told you, you're never alone around here.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Answer to our question:<br/></strong>The place where you would find a 'dull' sign is Boring, in Oregon in the US. 'Dull' and 'boring' are synonyms - they have the same meaning.</span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>To do</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are some more questions to check how much you understood.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>End of Session 3</strong></h3>\n<p>Did you do well in the quiz? If not, do try again. Join us in Session 4 when Neil and Finn play a fun game about crazy laws - and find out where it is illegal to get a fish drunk!</p></div>",

OK, number two: putting a stamp upside down on a letter is committing a crime.  </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>That has to be <strong>nonsense</strong>. You've <strong>made that up</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Well, it is on their list. But actually Neil, you're right. Royal Mail were asked about this and they confirmed that there's no rule against sticking a stamp upside down. They say it's a <strong>myth</strong> and not true. OK, number three. Christmas is not far away but is there a law that says it's illegal to eat <strong>mince pies</strong> on Christmas day? Are people doing something illegal if they eat a nice mince pie on Christmas day?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I must have broken the law many, many times. I think that this probably is on the list.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>And it is in fact on the list. OK, number four – the head of a dead whale found on the British coast automatically becomes <strong>property</strong> of the queen.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>That cannot be true.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Neil, that's a good answer. The law that's on the list is that the head of a dead whale becomes the property of the king, not the queen. So it was a trick question. So I'll give you a point for that as well. You've got three so far. Now, next question: it is illegal to enter the Houses of Parliament wearing a white suit.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Wearing a white suit. OK. I think I can't believe that's true. That has to be nonsense.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Well it's not on their list. What is on their list is that it's illegal to enter the Houses of Parliament wearing… maybe you know this one? </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil <br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I think I do. Is it <strong>a suit of armour</strong>?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>OK, a couple of Scottish ones now. in Scotland, if someone knocks on your door and asks to use your toilet, you must let them enter. Is that a law? And is it on the list?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I think it is on the list.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>It is on the list. You're right. Although apparently, the Law Commission says it cannot find any evidence of this in their books. So, it's one of these – I think people like it.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>It's not to say that it won't happen in the future.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Possibly, yes. And the law experts actually said the myth may have grown around local <strong>custom</strong> – and it hints at Scottish people's strong sense of <strong>hospitality</strong>. Next one is also about Scottish people. In the city of York it is legal to murder a Scotsman – that's a Scottish person – within the ancient city walls – but only if he's carrying a sword. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I really like these laws.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I'm not sure I like this one!</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I think it's true!</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>You think it's true?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil <br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I think it's on the list.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Well actually it's not on the list. And this is me being a bit naughty here. It is legal in the city of York within the ancient city walls to murder a Scotsman but only if he's carrying… a bow and arrow. Not a sword. So if you see me carrying a sword, I'm ok.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>My legal knowledge doesn't go that far.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>It fails you. Let's go further then and go outside the UK for the last three. In Ohio, this one, in the United States, it is illegal to get a fish drunk.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>How would you get a fish drunk? That's the question I'm thinking about now. I like this law so much that I'm going to say it's true. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I'm going to give you a point for that. That's on their list. It may be an <strong>urban myth</strong> - I don't care. Now let's move to France where they say it's illegal to name a pig Napoleon – is that…?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>That has to be nonsense. I don't believe that at all.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>It is nonsense. But it is on their list. Now number ten, this is our last question. Let's go back to the United States. Is it… illegal… in Alabama… <strong>to be blindfolded</strong> – that's to have a piece of cloth around your eyes while driving a vehicle? </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>I hope so. I hope it's illegal to drive whilst you are blindfolded. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Well I hope so too, and in fact it's on their list. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Great</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>What provoked them, why did they make this law?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Were there many people driving around…</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Blindfolded? Very good, well Neil that's the end of our stupid laws challenge. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil <br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Yeah how did I do?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>My scoring has not been very accurate. My stupid scoring. I'm going to give you eight out of ten. </span></span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Eight out of ten, 80%. I'm very happy with that.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>That's a very respectable, legal score.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil <br/></span></span></strong><span><span>We do recommend that you don't break any of these laws because even though they might sound like nonsense you never know if the police are going to come along and get you. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>That's true. So even if you think it's safe to murder a Scotsman…</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Or to get a fish drunk…</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Just don't do it.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil <br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Don't do it. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Finn<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Don't do it. That's our advice. And that's the end of our challenge. See you next time. Bye.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Neil<br/></span></span></strong><span><span>Bye.</span></span></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Crazy laws</h3>\n<p>In this session, to help you practise participle clauses, we have a fun challenge. It's all about strange laws that exist, or are said to exist!</p>\n<p>For example, there's an urban myth that London taxis have to carry a <strong>bale of hay</strong> in the<strong> boot</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, is it true? In the past, London taxis were not cars, but horse-drawn carriages. And instead of petrol, their fuel was hay! But the law stopped in 1976.</p>\n<p>So what are the funniest stupid laws?</p>\n<p>In our challenge, listen to Finn challenging Neil to identify the UK's favourite stupid laws, based on a survey which appeared in The Telegraph newspaper.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen and play along with Neil as he answer the questions. Then, do the quiz at the end to test yourself. There are examples of participle clauses in both the listening activity and the quiz. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now, do the quiz to test yourself. Which of these were on the list?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Your turn</h3>\n<p>So, what was your favourite law? And can you think of a funnier one?</p>\n<p>In fewer than 50 words, make up a crazy law - using a participle clause, if you can!</p>\n<p>If you need to remind yourself about the participle clauses, have another look at Session 2.</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>However strange it may seem, some of the following rules are true in my country.</p>\n<p>No sitting on chairs with missing leg</p>\n<p>No going up on upper floors by using stairs nor elevator</p>\n<p>No reaching the next train station earlier than the train you are on</p>\n<p>No using firearms to kill mosquitoes</p>\n<p>Homeless people found going around with no money will be fined</p>\n<p>No riding a motorbike with three or more passengers</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I like the law about get a fish drunk and dying in British Parliament. But I'd like to create own stupid law. Being honest I've heard this one. So starting - it is illegal to throw away deer from aircraft while flying. The law seems to exist in one of the US states but I don't remember in which one.</p>\n<h3>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</h3>\n<p>\"It's illegal to name a pig Napoleon\" it is my favourite crazy law.</p>\n<p>I've created my own stupid law: \"Dancing with a bear is not allowed.\"</p>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session. Now, before we go to stop people trying to get fish drunk, let us tell you what's coming up in Session 5… it's Gulliver time!

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And I’m Catherine. </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In today’s programme we’re talking about irregular verbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and as you know, there are lots of irregular verbs in English. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Lots and lots. Some, like <strong>write</strong>, have different forms for the past simple and past participle: <strong>wrote </strong>and <strong>written</strong>. </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes and it's not always easy to remember all those different forms!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It's not. Today, though, we’re going to explain how some of these verbs can be grouped into patterns to help remember the different forms.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine <br/></span></strong><span>We’ll give you lots of examples…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We’ll have a quiz…</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But first, let’s hear my interview with singer-songwriter Andrea.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: Who hasn’t spoken to Andrea for a long time?</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hi, Andrea. Now, tell us: when did you <strong>begin</strong> to <strong>sing</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>I <strong>sang</strong> in the school choir and I <strong>began</strong> to sing in bands when I was just ten.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, wow. So how many songs have you <strong>written</strong></span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>Over a hundred. I <strong>wrote</strong> one just before I <strong>drove</strong> here. </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span></span><strong>Finn</strong><br/><span>Right. And Andrea, I'm sure you have <strong>broken</strong> many men’s hearts. Tell us, who was the first?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>Oh, he was a boy called Marcus. I <strong>knew</strong> him at school. We <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street. He’s not <strong>spoken</strong> to me since we <strong>broke</strong> up.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span></span><strong>Finn</strong><br/><span>Since you broke up, that sounds bad. Thank you for coming and speaking to us today, Andrea.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>Thanks for having me.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>STING</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And there we are. So, we asked you: Who hasn’t spoken to Andrea for a long time?</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: Marcus. They haven’t spoken since they <strong>broke</strong> up. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Broke </strong>is the past simple of the verb <strong>break</strong> and it belongs to our first group of verbs. It has the pattern <strong>break</strong>, <strong>broke</strong>,<strong> broken</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, the past simple is <strong>broke</strong> and the past participle is <strong>broken</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Listen to this clip. Can you hear another verb with the same pattern? Here’s a clue. The word rhymes with <strong>broken</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>Oh, he was a boy called Marcus. I <strong>knew</strong> him at school. We <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street. He’s not <strong>spoken</strong> to me since we <strong>broke</strong> up.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK, and <strong>spoken </strong>rhymes with <strong>broken</strong>. The verb <strong>speak</strong> forms its past simple and past participle in the same way as <strong>break</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So it’s <strong>speak</strong>,<strong> spoke</strong>,<strong> spoken</strong>…</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>speak</strong> and <strong>break</strong> are pronounced differently although they both have e-a-k at the end.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>They do. Now, another verb with the same pattern is <strong>wake</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>… so it’s <strong>wake</strong>,<strong> woke</strong>,<strong> woken</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>… although we spell <strong>wake</strong>, w-a-k-e. It's not spelt e-a-k at the end. Now, in the interview, we had two other verbs with a different pattern.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, we had the past forms <strong>knew</strong> and <strong>grew</strong>. Andrea <strong>knew</strong> Marcus at school and she <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. These are the past simple forms of <strong>know</strong> and <strong>grow</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So, it’s <strong>know</strong>,<strong> knew</strong>,<strong> known</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Grow</strong>,<strong> grew</strong>,<strong> grown</strong>…</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Another verb with this pattern is <strong>blow</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So it’s <strong>blow, blew, blown</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So we've got two groups. The first one is verbs like <strong>speak</strong>,<strong> spoke</strong>,<strong> spoken</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And we have in our second group, verbs like <strong>grow</strong>,<strong> grew</strong>,<strong> grown</strong>. Listen to this second clip and see if you can spot two more patterns. Here’s a clue: listen to words that rhyme or have similar pronunciations.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span>Finn</strong><br/><span>When did you <strong>begin</strong> to <strong>sing</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>I <strong>sang</strong> in the school choir and I <strong>began</strong> to sing in bands when I was just ten.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span></span><strong>Finn</strong><br/><span>Oh, wow. How many songs have you <strong>written</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br/><span>Over a hundred. I <strong>wrote</strong> one just before I <strong>drove</strong> here. </span><strong><span> </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Did you hear the patterns <strong>begin</strong>…<strong> began </strong>and<strong> sing</strong>…<strong> sang?</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, this pattern is <strong>begin</strong>,<strong> began</strong>,<strong> begun</strong>…</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly, and we've got<strong> sing</strong>,<strong> sang</strong>,<strong> sung</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In the clip, we also had another pattern - <strong>wrote</strong>… <strong>written</strong>. So, that's the past simple and the past participle of <strong>write</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We heard another verb with this pattern… <strong>drove</strong>, which is the past simple of <strong>drive</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And the past participle is…</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>… <strong>driven</strong>. So that's <strong>drive</strong>, <strong>drove</strong>, <strong>driven</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now for a quiz. I’ll give you two parts of a verb. You have to complete the pattern. Ready? Number one: swim, swam, ______.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…<strong>swum</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well done if you got that right. Number two: speak, ______, spoken.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…<strong>spoke</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Correct. Number three: ______, wrote, written.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…<strong>write</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/><span>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/><span>And now, today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: combine irregular verbs with the same pattern in a short rhyme or story. The pattern of the rhyme will help you remember the different forms.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>.

We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the story endings that we received:</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>But when I got there she wasn't. I tried to call her but it seemed her phone had already broken down. So I drove farther with the hope that maybe she made a mistake with her location. I was searching for hours but I didn't find. I already was going to call police but fortunately my phone rang. It was her. She said that she was wrong and now she was being at home. I was surprised. It turned out she was helped by group of men passed next to her and they pulled her car to the road. I quickly drove out back to home.</p>\n<h3>Vincenzo Peccerillo, Italy</h3>\n<p>It took a couple of hours to reach my friend. I found her scared and chilled. It was impossible to start her car, so I picked my friend up and then we left for a safer place... When I was driving, she told me about what had happened some hours before. After a heated argument with her boyfriend, she had suddenly left his house, in spite of the terrible weather. She felt embarrassed to have called me in the night, but I was nice to her... I was happy to give her a hand in that awkward situation!</p>\n<h3>Manuel</h3>\n<p>And I was driving for almost the whole night looking for that car broken in the midle of the snow. While I was driving and imaging how the girl with such a marvellous voice would be, the snow kept on falling along the road during all my trip. It was when the new day started to break when I found her alone lying under an aok on a small hill</p>\n<h3>Antonio - Teresina - Piauí - Brasil</h3>\n<p>... After I'd driven for about an hour, I saw her car, but she wasn't there. I began to be more and more worried. The wind was blowing heavily. The fear grow inside me. Where she was, I spoke to myself.  Then I heard a song I knew, a song she liked to sing. I began to speak aloud, to cry her name. She was hidden behind a tree, with fear. Then we began to drive home.   </p>\n<h3>Angelica, Germany</h3>\n<p><strong>Snowy </strong><strong>mystery - Part </strong><strong>two:</strong></p>\n<p>I quickly <strong>wrote</strong> down her location, and <strong>drove</strong> out into the storm to find her.</p>\n<p>After a while I stopped and <strong>went out</strong> of my car because I <strong>began</strong> to get exhausted .But the   weather <strong>grew </strong>worse. The wind <strong>became</strong> extremely strong so I <strong>was blown</strong> to the ground. I <strong>lost</strong> my consciousness. In the end of this nightmare I <strong>woke up</strong> in a hospital. My arm <strong>was broken</strong> and I suffered from a terrible headache. When painkiller <strong>were brought</strong> by a cute young nurse my spirits rose.  I <strong>spent</strong> two days in hospital. Back at home I <strong>met</strong> my girlfriend who <strong>had been</strong> rescued by a passing lorry driver in the middle of that terrible night. I was unable to give her a helping hand after I <strong>had been taken</strong> into ambulance. Nor could I call her again due to my unconsciousness. Finally  I begged her pardon and she granted it immediately.</p>\n<p>After all we <strong>bought</strong> some wine and celebrated the happy end of this unintentionally adventure.</p>\n<h3>Francisco Javier Criado, Spain</h3>\n<p>When I arrived to the location I saw the car on the right side of the road. It was nearly covered by the snow and its lights was still turned on. She was trapped inside her car so  I digged a hole with  my own hands in order to open the right door. When I got her out she was still conscious and she told me, with a scary voice, she had been kidnapped by her own husband but, finally, she had escaped from him. Inmediatly I took her to my home and called the police.</p>\n<h3>Welton - Brazil</h3>\n<p>...whilst I'm driving to meet her, I turned on the radio in my car in order to listen to some news from the weather report. What I heard? Bad news. So I thought: nothing is not so bad that can't be worse. The authorities will close the roads if the weather get worse. So I drove as fast as I could trying not skid on the bends. I was driving for about forty minute when I saw her car stopped on the hard shoulder. For a couple of minutes I was glad to see her car, but suddenly I realized that she wasn't there. I was quite scared about that situation. As I know her mobile ran out the battery. Where she is? I looked everywhere near the car trying to found her. What should I do now? Stay here waiting for her? No, it's not the best option. So, I came back to my car and drove straight ahead on the road, hoping see her walking on the street. While I was driving again, my mobile rang. I saw on the display an  unknown name. I told for myself: it is not time for wrong call. But fortunately I recognize the voice. It was her. I was so happy. So immediately I asked her: where are you right now? And she told me where she was and everything was fine. Finaly at home she told me what had happened. She said: while I was waiting for you, the road car service passed me and offered some help. Then they took me to de rank of service where I could call you. What a nightmare!</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>but the storm started to be more and more strong and I had to stop my car on the road and wait there because I couldn't see less of one meter in front of me. I was waiting into the car until the storm finished. After that, I saw a small wood fire that I hadn't seen before. I started to run to the fire and there, I found with her. She was sitting in front of the fire and when she saw me, she was happy. More later I called the police for help, and they sent  an ambulance to rescue us.</p>\n<h3>Ardeshir, Iran</h3>\n<p>But when i  had arrived there i did not find her.suddenly i found her that was surrounded by some  thieves.I had become scared while i called to the police.fortunately a brave police man rescued her .Finally i had embraced her while she cried.I gut her to the home and now i am very happy for good ending.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>The only thing I saw when I arrived on the spot was her car with headlamps off pulled over on the side of the road. She seemed to be missing. I began to look around when suddenly my smartphone rang. I gave a sigh of relief at hearing her voice again. She told me that she had been rescued by police. When I reached her at police station, she told me that she and her husband had broke up and then she had just set off to reach my house when her car broke down along the way.</p>\n<h3>Manuel J, Spain</h3>\n<p>When I was coming down to the garage the lift stopped due probably to a power cut caused by the storm.</p>\n<p>I was stuck in the lift at least an hour and half until the alarm finally woke up some neighbours  and  a couple of them got rescue me from my cage.</p>\n<p>Driving dangerously with some centimeters of soft snow on the road I arrived to the address she gave me.</p>\n<p>Having passed two hours or more since she had called me,she became anxious and told me that, being so slow, didn't speak to her forever.</p>\n<h3>Cheryl Yau</h3>\n<p>When I arrived at the location, she was nowhere to be seen. Where could she be?  The surrounding was quiet and dark. I was the only soul here. I got down the car and shout frantically for her name. No responses. Did I get the location wrong? What had happened to her? I tried to call her on her mobile phone but her phone had die. I was at lost on what to do next. Just then, an alarm clock went off,  I opened my eyes, it was 7am. Phew, I was glad that it was just a dream. I figure that I must have miss her and I made a promise to myself to  call her tonight.</p>\n<h3>Madel, Italy</h3>\n<p>\"Immediately I got on my car. Her car was in the deepest of the forest,so unfortunately  I took at least a couple of hours to reach her (my friend). Outside an unbelievable storm of snow was in progress. When I found the car,strangely around it, there wasn't snow, but some small flowers and a  strange flimsy Iight, but I was so worried that I didn't think about it anymore.I opened the car door and... She was just fainted, thanks God. I took her to the hospital; later, when she got better, she told me that, before fainting  she had seen hundreds of tiny lights around her and she felt warm and protected. At first I didn' t believe her, I thought she was a little bit confused because of her frame of mind, but I thought twice and I remembered what I had seen, when she showed me a small shadow like a tattoo of a little fairy  on her skin: she was rescued by a fairy touch\". </p>\n<h3>Tszkiuu So</h3>\n<p>I quickly <strong>wrote</strong> down her location, and <strong>drove</strong> out into the storm to find her.</p>\n<p>But when i got there, i was strange that it's did not seem like have a storm before.</p>\n<p>Because the street was clean, no any rubbish on it. I looked around, there's nobody on the street.</p>\n<p>I tried to shout loudly, but nobody answered me. And i called her when i felt sad...</p>\n<p>Oh, i forgot her phone doesn't work because of storm. Suddenly, i heard that a girl scream ''Help''</p>\n<p>And, A girl who wear a red dress, ran to me. it's her, but her face is full of blood.</p>\n<p>Then, she took a knife, she wanted to kill me. I tried to run away from her...</p>\n<p>just kept running and running. Finally i was dazzled. </p>\n<h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>And that's it for this session. We hope you've enjoyed it.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry I'm so late, Finn. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Oh Rob… OK.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>There was such a long queue at the coffee machine. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Ah<strong> so late</strong>…<strong>such a long queue</strong> – great examples for today's topic, Rob.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Yes. Thank you very much. Yes, we’re talking about <strong>so, such, too</strong> and <strong>enough</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>When Rob said he was <strong>so late,</strong> he meant he was <span>very</span> late. Now Helen has some more examples using <strong>so</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Helen<br/></strong></span><span>This coffee is so good.<br/></span><span>Finn speaks English so well.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>So it's<strong> so</strong> before an adjective – This coffee is <strong>so good</strong>…<strong> so strong</strong>…<strong> so hot</strong>… </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Sounds good. Or before an <strong>adverb</strong>: He speaks English <strong>so well</strong>…<strong> so fluently</strong>…<strong> so fast</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>And we use <strong>such</strong> with a noun. Rob said there was <strong>such a long queue</strong>, meaning </span><span>the queue was very long. Here are more examples.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>My holiday was such fun!<br/></span><span>My holiday was such a disaster!</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>We say <strong>such</strong> <strong>fun </strong>without the indefinite article <strong>a </strong>because fun is uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>But it's <strong>such a</strong> <strong>disaster</strong> with the article because <strong>disaster </strong>is countable.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Now we often use <strong>such </strong>with an adjective <span>and</span> a noun together. Listen to this.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Helen<br/></strong></span><span>Adele has such an amazing voice.<br/></span><span>We had such good weather in Greece. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>So it's <strong>such</strong> good weather… <strong>such</strong> an amazing voice. Remember: with countable nouns </span><span>put the <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong> <span>after</span> 'such' not before. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Nowadays, you sometimes hear people use <strong>so</strong> with a <strong>noun</strong> or <strong>verb </strong>for emphasis. Like this.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>That dress is so last year.<br/></span><span>I'm so going to hug her when I see her.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>So if you say<strong> 'so last year'</strong> it means <span>really</span> not fashionable any more. <strong>So going to hug her</strong> means really going to give her a really good hug.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>We can use <strong>so</strong> and <strong>such</strong> with a <strong>that clause</strong> to describe cause and effect. Like this.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>It was so hot that they had to go indoors.<br/></span><span>It was such a hot day that they had to stay indoors.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>And we can leave <strong>that</strong> out, so we could say: <strong>It was so hot they had to go indoors</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>We also use <strong>so</strong> with <strong>many</strong> or <strong>much</strong> and a noun to describe a lot of something. It's </span><span><strong>so much</strong> with<strong> uncountable nouns</strong> and <strong>so many</strong> with <strong>countable nouns</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>What a great party! I had <strong>so much</strong> <strong>fun</strong>.<br/></span><span>We visited <strong>so many places</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So that's <strong>so</strong> and <strong>such</strong>. Now for <strong>too</strong> and <strong>enough</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Now we use<strong> enough</strong> with an adjective or adverb to say something is or isn't the right degree. So, if I ask Finn: <strong>Are you warm enough, Finn? </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I am, thanks.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I'm asking if it's the right temperature for you.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Notice <strong>enough</strong> comes <span>after</span> the adjective or adverb. We can also use <strong>enough</strong> after a verb.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>He doesn't <strong>sleep enough</strong>. He's always tired.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>When we use <strong>enough</strong> with a noun, it goes <span>before</span> the noun. We have <strong>enough food, enough time</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And sentences with <strong>enough</strong> are sometimes followed by <strong>to </strong>and a<strong> verb.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>She's definitely <strong>smart enough</strong> <strong>to become</strong> director.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>You know Rob, I think that's enough about enough!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Now to say there's more than necessary, we use <strong>too</strong> with an adjective or adverb. So we could say this office is <strong>too crowded, too noisy, too busy</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And I could say Rob that you're working <strong>too hard</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you very much. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>You work very hard.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>We can use <strong>too much</strong> or <strong>too many</strong> with a<strong> noun </strong>to say we have more than we need.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Helen<br/></span></strong><span>Ugh! You've put<strong> too much sugar </strong>in my tea!<br/></span><span>I ate <strong>too many biscuits</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And I think we have just enough time for a quiz. OK so which is correct, a or b? Are you ready Rob?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I am.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>OK. Number one. a) That's a so cute dog! b) That's such a cute dog.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well it's b) because it's <strong>such</strong> with an adjective and noun and the indefinite article comes after not before.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number 2. a) Is there money enough? Or b) Is there enough money?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's b) again because enough goes before a noun.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Correct. And finally, number 3. a) I can't afford it. It's too expensive. Or b) I can't afford it. It's so expensive.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You're trying to trick me. Both are correct.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Of course. That's right. Well done if you got them all right at home. And there's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Bye.</span></p> </div>",

Or did you enjoy it <strong>so</strong> much that you want more? <em><strong>So much that</strong> you want more?</em> Well, that's just one of the kinds of phrases that we look at in the next activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>I'm so going to learn this grammar!</h3>\n<p>So in Activity 1 we covered a lot of the basic uses of the intensifiers: so, such, too and enough. But, as you know, English isn't always that simple. It's time to learn some extra tips and tricks.</p>\n<h3>Intense point 1) So + noun or verb</h3>\n<p>In modern spoken English, so is increasingly being used before nouns and verbs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>That dress is <strong>so last year</strong>!</em> (That dress is last year’s fashion.)</li>\n<li><em>I’m <strong>so going to shout</strong> at him when I see him!</em> (so = really)</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong><span>Intense point 2) So/such + that for cause and effect</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><strong>So</strong> and <strong>such</strong> can be used with a <strong>that</strong> clause to express cause and effect, or reason and result. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span>She felt <strong>so upset</strong> <strong>that</strong> she started to cry.</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span>They had <strong>such an awful time</strong> <strong>that</strong> they said they’d never go again.</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>That</strong> introduces the result. But in informal English, we sometimes leave it out. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span>It was <strong>such a bad film</strong> he left before the end.</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span>There were <strong>so many restaurants</strong> they didn’t know which one to choose.</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span>Intense point 3): too with negative</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If we say a sentence with <strong>too</strong> in the <strong>negative form</strong>, then we mean it isn’t a problem. The form is <strong>not + too + adjective</strong>.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span>It’s <strong>not too late</strong> to buy tickets for the final. There are still some on sale.</span></em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Would you like even more practice with these intensifiers? Well, you're in luck, because 6 Minute Grammar with Finn and Callum will take you through all the main points, next!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>So, such, enough, too</h3>\n<p>Rob is late for the programme because there was <strong>such</strong> a long queue for coffee! But he finally joined Finn and they had <strong>enough</strong> time to explain how to use <strong>so</strong>, <strong>such</strong>, <strong>enough</strong> and <strong>too</strong>. So listen to the examples and try the quiz to test yourself. That's all in this edition of 6 Minute Grammar.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>You can download 6 Minute Grammar from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-28/downloads\">Unit 28 downloads page</a>.

Here are a few suggestions to help you in your search. Read the article and do some exercises to check how well you understood it.</p>\n<h3><strong>To do<br/></strong></h3>\n<p>Read this article about dating, then answer the question: <strong>What's the best way to find out if you have chemistry with someone?</strong> The answer is at the bottom of the article.<br/><br/></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>Part 1</strong><br/>These days, it's common to go online if you're looking for love. You can sign up to a <strong>reputable</strong> dating website, get full access to their database and find the right person by browsing though hundreds - if not thousands - of profiles. Is that too much trouble for you? You could try one of the dating sites which try to match people with similar interests. You fill in a questionnaire - some have as many as 400 questions - and then it's over to an <strong>algorithm</strong> to play Cupid. It'll tell you who you're compatible enough with to have a chance of finding love.</p>\n<p>But algorithms might not stop you being a victim of a '<strong>catfish</strong>'. These are criminals who create a fake profile, featuring a good-looking mature widower, or perhaps a young <strong>sassy</strong> woman, whose apparent <strong>eagerness</strong> to express their undying love for you is just a cover to gain your trust - and get your money.<br/><strong><br/>Part 2<br/></strong>New <strong>niche</strong> websites increase your chances of finding someone who thinks the same way you do. There are dating sites for people of similar religious beliefs, for pet lovers, for sci-fi fans, gardeners, and... the list is endless. There is also one which made the headlines recently for… well, for probably destroying marriages rather than arranging them. Ashley Madison is a dating site for people looking for an <strong>extra-marital affair</strong>. The site was hacked - and details of more than 33 million accounts were leaked. <strong>Red faces</strong> all around!<br/><strong><br/>Part 3<br/></strong>If you're always on the move, apps like Tinder are an option. It's so popular that hand movements on the application design are becoming part of informal language. Expressions like 'swipe right' can be used when you like someone's appearance or 'swipe left' when you don't. It's said to have 50 million active users. Critics - and some of its fans - say its primary use is as a <strong>casual sex</strong> app because it finds potential matches based on how near the person is to you. <br/><strong><br/>Part 4</strong><br/>What? Pictures alone are not enough for you to make a choice? Don't despair, there's still hope for you. Try speed dating! Some companies organise singles nights and singles parties to get people looking for love together. The idea is said to have come from a rabbi who wanted to help single Jewish people to get married. And it's so clever: daters get to meet each other for just three to five minutes: long enough to see is if there is any <strong>chemistry,</strong> but not long enough to be embarrassed if there's no attraction. A 2005 study at the University of Pennsylvania of speed dating events found that most people make up their mind about their date in the first three seconds of a three-minute meeting. Don't blink - you might miss finding the love of your life!</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5<br/></strong>Still not convinced you can find love this way? You're such a romantic, aren't you - algorithms and agencies don't impress you, and you don't fall in love in three seconds. How about trusting your friends to find you a mate? It's like the old idea of courtship at play from the 19th century writer Jane Austen's novels. Your friends know your likes and dislikes, so they're perfectly placed to set up a <strong>blind date</strong> for you. They might throw a party to allow you and your potential partner to check each other out - or just have you both round for dinner.</p>\n<p>In China, blind dates are sometimes set up by young people's relatives, who meet in local parks to exchange ideas and do some matchmaking. So, if you live in Shanghai and your best photos and CV are nowhere to be found at home, they could be in the hands of your spouse-hunting grandparents - and you might end up on a date just to please them, rather than to please yourself. <br/><strong><br/>Part 6<br/></strong>Well, there is a saying: \"If you want something done properly, do it yourself.\" So, if you want to find love, maybe you should just stop expecting others to do it for you and go out there. Many people find their future partner in college, in the office or just … well, going to a nightclub and <strong>flirting</strong>. Love might be something you find when you are ready for it. If you are not open to a relationship, if you are such a <strong>fussy</strong> person that your ideal partner has to be perfect in every way, there is no way you'll find a date.   <br/><br/><strong>The answer to our question:<br/></strong>The best way to find out if you have chemistry with somebody is to meet them in person rather than looking at a picture or exchanging messages online.</p>\n<h3>To do<strong><br/></strong></h3>\n<p>Now have a go at this activity, to check how much of the article you understood.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>End of Session 3</strong></h3>\n<p>Did you do well in the quiz? If not, come back later and try again. In Session 4 you'll hear a conversation between the owner of the Dodgy Dating Agency - and a very unhappy client...</p></div>",

In this programme we're talking about phrases from Shakespeare. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They're phrases that were either invented by Shakespeare or used by him in his plays and that we still use a lot today. We'll give you plenty of examples of these and we'll teach you what they mean.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We'll have a quiz; and we'll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's start with Danny. He's talking about cooking, and entertaining friends.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And while you listen, think about this question: Does Danny think it's easy to find special ingredients for recipes?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Danny<br/></strong>For some people food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong> and I have friends who, whenever I visit, produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>! But in my opinion, cooking<strong> is not for the faint-hearted</strong>. I really hate spending <strong>forever and a day</strong> in the kitchen. Dinner parties usually mean trying to track down some special ingredient, which ends up being <strong>a wild-goose chase</strong>. It's pretty much <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong> that my chosen recipe won't work out as I hope. So I just throw a party once a year to repay all my friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>. Fortunately, every one of them <strong>has a</strong> <strong>heart of gold</strong>, so they understand!</p>\n<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">That was Danny. And we asked you: Does Danny think it's easy to find special ingredients for recipes?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>And the answer is no, because usually it's <strong>a wild-goose chase</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now <strong>a wild-goose chase </strong>is used in Romeo and Juliet. This means a situation where you waste time chasing after something that you can't get.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So Danny clearly has had bad experiences of trying to find ingredients and not succeeding.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly. Well, there are four more Shakespearean phrases in our first clip. Listen out for them!</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>CLIP 1       <br/></strong>For some people food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong> and I have friends who, whenever I visit, produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>! But in my opinion, cooking <strong>is</strong> <strong>not for the faint-hearted</strong>. I really hate spending <strong>forever and a day</strong> in the kitchen.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong>. That's the beginning and ending of everything, which means it's the most important thing. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And that's why they always produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>. Clearly if something is suitable for the gods, it is the best possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But cooking <strong>is</strong> <strong>not for the faint-hearted</strong>, Danny says. <strong>The faint-hearted</strong> are people who lack courage or determination and he thinks people like that shouldn't cook. This phrase shows how difficult Danny finds cooking.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And he hates spending a long time in the kitchen.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>He does. <strong>Forever and a day</strong> is a very long time! Right, there are three more phrases coming up in our next clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>It's pretty much <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong> that my chosen recipe won't work out as I hope. So I throw a party once a year to repay all my friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>. Fortunately, every one of them has <strong>a</strong> <strong>heart of gold</strong>, so they understand!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, if something is <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong>, it's a result that is certain to happen. He thinks it's certain that his recipe won't work out.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And that's why he entertains his friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>. Now if you deal with things <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>, that means you deal with them all together and suddenly, like a bird sweeping down through the air to attack something.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, he doesn't want to cook for people more often than necessary! But fortunately his friends understand how he feels, don't they?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>They do. They each <strong>have a heart of gold</strong>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Finn</strong><strong>               <br/></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine     <br/></span></strong><span>And me, Catherine. Hello.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>                <br/></span><span>In today’s programme we’re talking about three different verb patterns. First, what exactly do we mean by verb patterns, Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine <br/></span></strong><span>Well, here we mean the various language patterns that follow the main verb in a clause or sentence. And the first pattern we’re looking at is verbs which are followed by <strong>that. </strong>Here’s our first example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>My doctor<strong> explained that </strong>I had to go to hospital<strong>.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>My doctor<strong> explained that </strong>I had to go to hospital<strong>. </strong>So, we have a verb –<strong> explain, </strong>plus<strong> that,</strong> and did you notice that the word <strong>that</strong> is followed by an independent clause? In other words, it's followed by a group of words with a subject and verb, just like like a full sentence. In our example the independent clause was: <strong>I had to go to hospital</strong>. Now, other verbs that take this pattern include <strong>say</strong>,<strong> warn</strong>,<strong> explain</strong>,<strong> suggest </strong>and<strong> know</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Right. The second pattern is verbs that are followed by the i-n-g form, or <strong>-ing</strong> form of another verb. Let's have an example.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>We<strong> discussed waiting </strong>until next year.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, lots of verbs take this pattern, including <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> try</strong>,<strong> love</strong>,<strong> like</strong>,and<strong> hate</strong>. And the third pattern is verbs that are followed by the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>He<strong> offered to see </strong>me again in a month’s time.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And verbs that take this pattern include <strong>want</strong>, <strong>need</strong>, <strong>hope</strong>, <strong>love</strong> and <strong>promise</strong>. But it’s important to know that with some verbs, you can choose between two of the patterns. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>You can. So with the verbs <strong>suggest </strong>and<strong> recommend</strong> you can choose between <strong>that plus a clause</strong> or an <strong>–ing</strong> form. Here's an example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>We <strong>suggest that</strong> you go to the hospital in Oxford.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Or:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>We <strong>suggest going</strong> to the hospital in Oxford.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And with the verbs <strong>ask</strong>,<strong> propose </strong>and <strong>promise</strong>, you can choose between either <strong>that </strong>plus a clause, or the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. Another example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>I <strong>promised that</strong> I would let him know my decision.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Or:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>I <strong>promised to let</strong> him know my decision.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>A good grammar book will give you a full list of verbs that take more than one pattern. Make sure you keep one handy!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Top tip. Now, another point is that some of these verbs can take an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. The verb<strong> ask </strong>is a good example. Listen to this:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>I <strong>asked the doctor to change </strong>my medication.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT           <br/></span></strong><span>This is bbclearningenglish.com</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn                <br/></span></strong><span>And we’re looking at verb patterns. Well, we’ve said that some verbs can have an object </span><span>before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. But there are a few verbs that must <strong>always</strong> have an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. The verbs <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> invite</strong>,<strong> tell</strong> and <strong>warn</strong> are like this.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>He <strong>advised me to think</strong> carefully about it. He <strong>told me not to</strong> hurry.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Right. Actually that last example is an interesting one. It shows that when you use a negative </span><span>form with the infinitive, the word <strong>not</strong> goes before, not after, the infinitive with <strong>to</strong>. Like this – He <strong>told me not to hurry.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>Good point. The verbs <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> ask </strong>and<strong> warn</strong> are like that too, aren’t they? He <strong>advised </strong></span><span><strong>me not to worry</strong>, for example.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that’s right. Of course, you can use <strong>not</strong> before <strong>-ing</strong> forms as well. Listen to this:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>They <strong>recommend not eating</strong> a big meal in the evening.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But infinitives are a bit different because you lose the word <strong>to</strong> in the negative. So it’s </span><span>possible to say:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Example <br/></strong>They <strong>recommend that you not eat</strong> a big meal in the evening.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But that sounds very formal. We usually use <strong>don’t</strong> instead of <strong>not</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Example<br/></span></strong><span>They <strong>recommend that you don’t eat</strong> a big meal in the evening.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK, by now you have probably noticed that most of the verbs we are talking about belong to a particular type.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly. They are mostly verbs that explain, suggest, advise, offer, promise, report or warn.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Try to look out for these verbs and you’ll soon get to know which patterns you need to </span><span>use.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>                <br/></span><span>And now: it’s quiz time! Which sentence is correct? a) Carl explained me he would be late home. b) Carl explained that he would be late home.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>b) is correct. Carl explained that he would be late home. Number 2. Which is correct? a) Which day do you advise us to come? b) Which day do you advise that we come?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Aha. Both a) and b) are correct! </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Aha, yes. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span> <br/>Which day do you advise us to come? and Which day do you advise that we come? Right, number three. a) She warned me not to go out. b) She warned me not going out.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And a) is correct. She warned me not to go out.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And that is the end of the quiz. Congratulations if you got them all right.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>     <br/></span><span>Congratulations indeed. And that’s all for now about verb patterns, but there’s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>What comes after a verb?</h3>\n<p>There are many verbs in English and there are many different patterns for what comes after a verb.</p>\n<p>Some common patterns are:</p>\n<p><strong>Verb + infinitive with to</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I decided <strong>to take</strong> the car to work. (To decide to do something)</em></li>\n<li><em>She pretended <strong>to be</strong> asleep. (To pretend to do something)</em></li>\n<li><em>He offered <strong>to cook</strong> the dinner. (To offer to do something)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verb + gerund<br/></strong>A gerund is the noun form of a verb. In these examples the clause with the gerund acts as the object of the verb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He admitted <strong>eating the last biscuit</strong>. (To admit doing something)</em></li>\n<li><em>It took years but I've finally quit <strong>smoking</strong>. (To quit doing something)<br/></em></li>\n<li><em>After she finished <strong>reading the book</strong> she turned off the light and went to sleep. (To finish doing something)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verb  + (that) clause<br/></strong>In these examples the clause that comes after the verb is that verb's object. You can leave out <strong>that</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I understand <strong>(that)</strong> <strong>you weren't happy with your pay rise</strong>. (To understand something)</em></li>\n<li><em>She assumed <strong>(that)</strong> <strong>the bill had already been paid</strong>. (To assume something)</em></li>\n<li><em>I suggest <strong>(that)</strong> <strong>you try the salmon, it's delicious</strong>. (To suggest something)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning tip</h3>\n<p>When noting down new verbs it's a good idea to write down the pattern as well as some examples. In the examples above the pattern is written in brackets after the examples.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Infinitive with to or gerund?</h3>\n<p>There are no simple rules for working out which verbs are used with the <strong>infinitive with to</strong> and which are used with the <strong>gerund</strong>. You need to learn them individually.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 common verbs that can be followed by the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>to afford to do something: </strong><em>We can't afford to go on holiday this year.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to arrange to do something: <em></em></strong><em>Let's arrange to meet up soon.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to decide to do something: </strong><em>I've decided to leave my job.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to hope to do something: </strong><em>I hope to see you soon.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to learn to do something: </strong><em>She's learning to play the guitar.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to manage to do something: </strong><em>He managed to do his homework by himself for the first time.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to offer to do something:</strong><em> I'd like to offer to help with the party.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to refuse to do something:</strong><em> I can't believe he refused to change his mind.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to vote to do something:</strong><em> Parliament has voted to raise income tax by 1%.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to want to do something: </strong><em>I really want to get home early today.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here are 10 to use with the <strong>gerund</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>to admit doing something:</strong> <em>He admitted breaking the window.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to avoid doing something: </strong><em>I think my dog would do almost anything to avoid having a bath.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to delay doing something:</strong><em> Don't delay booking your ticket, they're selling like hot cakes.<br/></em></li>\n<li><strong>to deny doing something:</strong><em> She denied taking the money from her mum's wallet.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to enjoy doing something:</strong><em> I enjoy going to the cinema by myself.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to finish doing something:</strong><em> When do you think you'll have finished painting the house?</em></li>\n<li><strong>to miss doing something: </strong><em>Since our son was born I really miss having a lie-in at the weekend.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to quit doing something:</strong><em> I had to quit playing football after I broke my leg.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to risk doing something:<em></em> </strong><em>He was so upset I couldn't risk letting him drive home by himself.</em></li>\n<li><strong>to suggest doing something:</strong><em> </em><em>The doctor suggested eating more fresh fruit.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Gerund = Noun</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember that a gerund is the noun form of a verb.

No chocolate for you!</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>New parents have a tough time... they have to adapt to a life with very little sleep, with a new level of responsibility, and with one unexpected challenge: unwanted advice! </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>In this session we're going to read an article about annoying advice. Then there's a quiz which will test how well you understood, and how well you can use <strong>verb patterns</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Read the article twice. The first time you read, try to answer this question: What does the author suggest your partner's parents mean when they say your child is hungry?</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>For parents about to have their first baby, there will be many things <strong>in short supply</strong> – sleep, for example. One thing, however, that new parents will not <strong>be short of</strong> is advice.</p>\n<p>Family, friends and even total strangers are always keen to pass on their <strong>worldly</strong> expertise. And you can’t escape the self-appointed ‘experts’ on TV, in books, and on the internet. <strong>Parents-to-be</strong>, be warned!</p>\n<p>We all have those <strong>competent</strong> (often <strong>patronising</strong>), friends. You know the type. Their life is organized to an abnormal degree. The right school has been arranged since <strong>conception</strong>. Their babies have never cried or thrown up in the car. When you discuss <strong>weaning</strong>, <strong>potty training </strong>or getting babies to sleep, they make it clear that they know everything and you know nothing.</p>\n<p>Then there are those whose own life is falling apart but who still offer to share their wisdom with you. They haven’t spoken to their own children for a decade, but they consider themselves relationship <strong>gurus</strong>. You haven’t asked them to advise you, but they <strong>drone on</strong> endlessly.</p>\n<p>The in-laws are another minefield. Before the birth, they promised not to interfere, but at every opportunity they tell you that they know what your child is thinking: “I’m sure he’s hungry.” “I think he wants to sleep.” There is the unspoken <strong>implication</strong> you are not <strong>up to the job</strong>.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget the internet of course. Trudy at the gym recommends reading the blog of an ‘expert’ living in a desert in Idaho<strong>, </strong>whose advice has the moral authority of a <strong>ransom</strong> note, whilst Rudy at bookclub suggests checking out the YouTube video of a French psychologist who is the latest craze. They’re on the internet, so their advice must be true.</p>\n<p>And then there are the parenting books. Behind those covers with cute babies and <strong>toddlers </strong>making fairy cakes are <strong>hefty</strong> <strong>manuals </strong>worthy of army <strong>boot camps</strong>. Inside are lists of rules for everything – even advising you to open the curtains promptly at 8.23am.</p>\n<p>But don’t despair. There are some useful bits of advice out there: they propose being realistic from the start, they warn you to forget having a social life; and suggest giving up such <strong>cherished</strong> ideals as never allowing your child to eat chocolate or watch TV before they are one year old. There are also excellent practical tips for new mums and dads: if visitors offer to make tea, accept; sleep when baby sleeps and forget the housework.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best advice is to ignore all advice and do it your own way.</p>\n<h3>Answer</h3>\n<p>What does the author suggest your partner's parents mean when they say your child is hungry? The author suggests that your partner's parents might be thinking you're not a good enough parent (you're not up to the job).</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge of verb patterns. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>In Session 4, Finn offers to look after a friend's young kids. He soon finds out how difficult it can be...</p></div>",

OK…</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Mike did <strong>warn</strong> me not to feed them anything before lunch. But I… well… I forgot and I bought them ice-creams. And so… after that they didn't eat lunch, and they got hungry again before dinner… so I gave them some chocolates and jelly – OK. Stupid me. I know… it was all I could find. Mike did <strong>tell</strong> me not to give them anything sweet. But, yeah, oh well. He actually <strong>recommended</strong> I make them something healthy and <strong>nutritious</strong> like stew, but – I mean – how can you with two screaming kids? And actually I did <strong>start</strong> making stew, but then I <strong>stopped</strong> to take Max to the toilet and then… well, let's just say chocolate seemed the easiest option.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Where were we? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So now it's well past their bedtime and Max has been jumping on his bed for about an hour. Gwyn won't stop crying. Yes Gwyn… I know. I've tried to <strong>explain</strong> that she needs to be sleep before Mummy and Daddy get home because otherwise I'll be in, I mean they'll be in lots of trouble.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>What a mess! </span></span>Anyway, Neil, what do you <strong>suggest</strong> I do?

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil and…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...I'm Finn. Today's programme is all about academic English. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If you are going to study or you are studying at an English-speaking university, you might be wondering how you'll cope with understanding lectures and academic texts…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>…and writing essays.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Academic English is different to the English people speak and write every day…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It's more formal and uses higher level words. So in today's programme, we'll give you ideas for understanding words and phrases that you'll come across…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>…and some advice for writing essays and giving presentations. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <br/><span>We'll also give you tips for studying in English… </span><span>But first, let's look at three main features of academic English: difficult English vocabulary... </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>…specialist subject vocabulary…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and language for organising essays and presentations.<br/><br/></span><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now when you come across a word you don't know in an academic text or lecture, you can try to guess its meaning by looking at the context…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…or by seeing if the word looks like a word in your own language.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>This is a particularly useful strategy if your own language has lots of words from Greek or Latin as many of the words used in academic English come from those languages. Words, for example, like <strong>microscopic,</strong> which means tiny, or <strong>analysis</strong>, which means study…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>…or <strong>regeneration</strong>, which means renewal. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Another strategy for working out the meaning is to look at how a word is constructed. Academic English words often have prefixes and suffixes.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Remember, a prefix comes before the main part of the word and can change a word's meaning. For example, the prefix <strong>de</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e,</strong> means removing something, or reversing something.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, <strong>de-population</strong> means a reduction in the number of people somewhere, and <strong>de-forestation</strong> means clearing of trees from an area. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Suffixes are attached to the end of words.A common suffix in English is <strong>-ise, </strong>spelt <strong>i-s-e.</strong> Examples of words with <strong>-ise</strong> are <strong>stabilise, characterise </strong>and<strong> specialise</strong>. And these words are spelt with <strong>–ize</strong> in American English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, they are.

Now you can help yourself in two ways: Firstly, prepare yourself before lectures. Find some texts on your subject, on the internet or in journals and magazines, and study the recurring specialist words in those texts. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and to help yourself with this get hold of an English-English dictionary, and an English subject dictionary – for example of Medicine, or Law, or Linguistics. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And secondly, listen to English radio and watch TV – now there are lots of specialist features which can help improve both your general and specialist English – and of course the BBC website has sections which have stories on technology, and science, and arts, which can also help.<span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>When writing your academic piece or giving a presentation, you will need to structure and organise your writing or presentation by using signposting language. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>You use signposts to indicate important parts of your essay such as stating its purpose, its structure, your views, the main points, and the direction of the argument and conclusions at the end as well.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Linking words and phrases show connections between sentences and paragraphs. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, so Neil, let's give some examples of signposts.

Have a study buddy – that's someone you can study with. You can test each other and support each other.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And another one, set aside time for regular language study in addition to your academic study.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Time for a quiz. Complete the sentences. Number one: Many words in academic English come from a) Latin words, b) American words or c) newspapers?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It's a) Latin words. Now question two: A good way to start an essay is a) for example, b) in conclusion or c) this essay argues that?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And it's c) this essay argues that. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And the last question is: A good way to end an essay is a) on the other hand, b) in conclusion or c) this essay argues that?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is b) in conclusion.

Generally the materials we need to read are written in a particular style and the essays we are required to write are expected to be written in a similar style. This is what we call <strong>academic English.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Academic English</strong> still needs to be clear and easy to follow but it does tend to use more complicated vocabulary and less personal grammar forms. Compare these two sentences. They have similar meanings, but one is more appropriate for an academic context.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The scientific consensus holds that humankind bears a significant responsibility for the extent of climate change.</em></li>\n<li><em>Most scientists say that a lot of climate change is mostly our fault.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>General</strong>: Most scientists say that...<br><strong>Academic: </strong>The scientific consensus holds that...</br></p>\n<p><strong>General: </strong>...is mostly our fault.<br/><strong>Academic: </strong>...humankind bears a significant responsibility for...</p>\n<p><strong>General: </strong>...a lot of...<br/><strong>Academic: </strong>...the extent of...</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Features of Academic English</h3>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines for academic English writing.</p>\n<p><strong>Contractions<br/></strong>Avoiding using contractions in <strong>academic</strong> <strong>English</strong> writing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The results won't be released until they've been verified. </em><strong><br/></strong></li>\n<li><em>The results will not be released until they have been verified. (Better for academic writing)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Personal pronouns and passive<br/></strong>Using the personal pronoun <strong>I</strong> is not forbidden in academic writing but when expressing opinions in objective contexts, such as scientifc subjects, it is discouraged.</p>\n<p>It is also good practice to avoid the use of <strong>you</strong> to refer to the reader. The use of the passive is very common in academic texts and makes it easier to avoid the use of personal pronouns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>I completed</strong> the experiment as <strong>I was told to</strong>.</em></li>\n<li><em>The experiment <strong>was completed as instructed</strong>. </em>(Better for academic writing)<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong></li>\n<li><em>As<strong> you can see</strong>, the experiment was successful.<br/></em></li>\n<li><em>As <strong>can be seen</strong>, the experiment was successful.</em> (Better for academic writing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Multi-word (phrasal) verbs<br/></strong>Multi-word verbs are a feature of informal English. Many multi-word verbs have a single word alternative. In academic contexts it is generally advised to use the more formal single word instead of the multi-word verb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>It was difficult <strong>to get hold of</strong> the raw material.</em></li>\n<li><em>It was difficult <strong>to obtain</strong> the raw material. </em>(Better for academic writing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Slang, colloquial language and subjective descriptors<br/></strong>It is usually inappropriate to use slang expressions, colloquial language and subjective adjectives and adverbs in an academic context.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>There was <strong>like loads of awesome stuff</strong> made before the factory closed.</em></li>\n<li><em>Before its closure the factory manufactured <strong>a large variety of popular goods</strong>.</em> (Better for academic writing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vocabulary with Latin or French origin<br/></strong>English words which come from Latin or French are generally more formal than those with Anglo-Saxon roots. This is useful for speakers of language such as French, Italian or Spanish as many words will be familiar, though beware of 'false friends'. For speakers of languages such as Arabic, Japanese and Chinese that do not share similar roots with English, this is more difficult. Usually more formal vocabulary is longer, with more syllables.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>China <strong>makes</strong> a lot of steel.</em></li>\n<li><em>A large amount of steel is <strong>manufactured</strong> in China.</em> (Better for academic writing)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Test your academic English in the quiz by choosing the more formal vocabulary and grammar. </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>In the next activity we take a look at structuring a formal presentation. Or perhaps we should say: The structure of formal presentations is examined in the following activity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Structure of a basic presentation</h3>\n<p>In an academic or business situation you may have to give a presentation. There are many different styles of presentation but there is a basic structure which can be used as a template.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction<br/></strong>Tell your audience what you're going to be talking about. Here are some phrases you could use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Let me start by...</em></li>\n<li><em>I'll start by...</em></li>\n<li><em>First of all I'll...</em></li>\n<li><em>I'd like to begin by...</em></li>\n<li><em>My aim/purpose today is...</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Body<br/></strong>Deliver your presentation with a clear structure and good signposting. This means using appropriate vocabulary to link and develop ideas. Here are a few suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Moving on<br/></strong><em>Let me now turn to...<br/>Let's move on to...<br/>Turning to...<br/>I'd like now to...<br/>Next...<br/>Let's look now at...<br/><br/></em></li>\n<li><strong>Ordering information<br/></strong><em>Firstly... secondly... thirdly... lastly<br/>First of all... then... next... after that... finally<br/>To start with... later... To finish<br/><br/></em></li>\n<li><strong>Giving examples<br/></strong><em>For example...<br/>A good example of this is...<br/>To illustrate this point...<br/>This can be seen...</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<br/></strong>Summarise your points and any conclusions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Before I finish I'd like to...</em></li>\n<li><em>Let's recap, shall we?<br/></em></li>\n<li><em>I'd like to sum up now...</em></li>\n<li><em>Let me summarise briefly what I've said...</em></li>\n<li><em>If I can just sum up the main points...</em></li>\n<li><em>So, in conclusion/summary...</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Preparation</h3>\n<p><strong>Planning</strong><br/>Plan your presentation carefully. Thorough preparation will make you more confident and help you to overcome your nervousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br/>Think about what you want to achieve. Are you aiming to inform, persuade, train or to entertain your audience?</p>\n<p><strong>Audience</strong><br/>Whom exactly will you be addressing? How many people will be attending? What do they need to know? What do they already know? What will they expect in terms of content and approach?</p>\n<p><strong>Content</strong><br/>Brainstorm your ideas first. Then decide which are the most relevant and appropriate to your audience and to your objectives and carry out any research that is necessary. Be selective. Don't try to cram too much into your presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach</strong><br/>A good rule of thumb is to tell your audience what you're going to say, say it, and then tell your audience what you've said. Try to develop your key points in an interesting and varied way, drawing on relevant examples, figures etc. for support as appropriate. You might also like to include one or two anecdotes for additional variety and humour.</p>\n<p><strong>Organisation</strong><br/>Think about how you will organise your content. Your presentation should have a clear, coherent structure and cover the points that you wish to make in a logical order. Most presentations start with a brief introduction and end with a brief conclusion. Use the introduction to welcome your audience, introduce your topic/subject, outline the structure of your talk, and provide guidelines on questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual aids</strong><br/>If you have a lot of complex information to explain, think about using charts, diagrams, graphs etc. on a flipchart or on screen. Visual aids can make a presentation more interesting and easier to understand, but make sure they are appropriate and clear - don't try to put too much information on each one.</p>\n<p><strong>Rehearsal</strong><br/>Allow time to practise your presentation - this will give you a chance to identify any weak points or gaps, and assess its length relative to the time available. You will also be able to make sure that the timing of each section is appropriate, and to ensure that you can pronounce any figures and proper names confidently and correctly.</p>\n<h3>Delivery</h3>\n<p><strong>Nerves</strong><br/>You will probably be nervous at the beginning of your presentation. Dont worry - most people are nervous in this situation. Try not to speak too fast during the first couple of minutes - this is the time you establish your rapport with the audience and first impressions are very important. You may find it helpful to memorise your introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Audience rapport</strong><br/>Try to be enthusiastic - your interest in the subject will carry your audience along. Look around your audience as you speak - eye contact is essential for maintaining a good rapport. You will also be able to pick up signals of boredom, disagreement or lack of interest, in which case you can make amendments or cut your presentation short.</p>\n<p><strong>Body language</strong><br/>Stand rather than sit when delivering your presentation and try to be aware of any repetitive movements, awkward mannerisms or hand gestures that might irritate your audience.</p>\n<p><strong>Voice quality</strong><br/>You must be clearly audible at all times - the golden rule is that everyone must understand everything! - so don't let your voice drop at the end of sentences. If you vary your intonation, your voice will be more interesting to listen to and you will be able to make your points more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual aids</strong><br/>Use your visual aids confidently, making sure you allow your audience time to absorb information from flipcharts and screens.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Practise the language of presentations in the quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of session</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session. We hope you've picked up some useful tips for academic English and giving presentations.</p></div>",

And now for the future perfect continuous:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>In January, I’ll have been studying for three years.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Here, the action – studying - goes right up to the specified time and will probably continue afterwards.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, we use the future perfect continuous rather than the future perfect when we want to focus on the continuous nature of the activity and how long it will be going on for. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We often use the future perfect continuous with <strong>for </strong>plus an amount of time. So, in the earlier example, we had <strong>for three years</strong>.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have some more examples of the future perfect continuous:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Tomorrow <strong>I’ll have been working </strong>here for six months.</span></p>\n<p><span>In July <strong>we’ll have been living</strong> in Dubai for two years.</span></p>\n<p><span>By the time the bus gets here, <strong>we’ll have been waiting</strong> over an hour.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Notice that the last example didn’t have <strong>for</strong>, as we don’t always have to include it.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now, we usually use a time phrase with both tenses to state the particular time in the future. These often start with <strong>by</strong> or <strong>in</strong>. Listen to these examples: </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><strong>By 2020</strong> the city’s population will have doubled.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>In June</strong> I’ll have been unemployed for five months.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>You can use <strong>by </strong>or <strong>in</strong>… with any future day, date, month, season or special day.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>For the future perfect continuous, the time phrases sometimes begin with <strong>in </strong>or <strong>on</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><strong>On Sunday</strong>, he’ll have been travelling for three weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>We often use <strong>when</strong> or <strong>by the time </strong>in time phrases with both tenses. Listen to these examples:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob <br/>When your train gets in</strong>, we’ll have been waiting for over two hours.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>By the time you get</strong> home, the chicken will have been cooking for two hours.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>By the time you get back</strong>, we’ll have had dinner.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Notice that <strong>when </strong>and<strong> by the time </strong>are followed by a verb. This verb is in the present simple, not the future. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, as well as predicting future events and situations, we can also use the future perfect and future perfect continuous to say what we imagine might or might not have happened:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>They <strong>won’t have arrived</strong> yet.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Looking back from the future</h3>\n<p>Tomas is struggling with his <strong>DIY</strong>. He's not very <strong>good with his hands</strong> but he doesn't want to pay for a professional. Read what he has to say about his current situation:</p>\n<p><em>\"You know, I thought I could do it in time. I only had to paint the spare room. That was weeks ago. I'm nowhere near finished and in two weeks my parents will be visiting. By the time they get here I will have been working on it for nearly three months. I don't know where they are going to sleep.\"</em></p>\n<p>Tomas looks back from a time in the future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>By the time they get here...</em> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>He predicts that he will <strong>still be doing something then</strong> that <strong>he started before</strong> that future time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>... I will have been working on it for nearly three months.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this he uses the <strong>future perfect continuous</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, we use the future perfect continuous when we look back from a time in the future at an action that will continue up to that point in time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If I don't stop before midday, I <strong>will have been reading</strong> this book for 24 hours non-stop.</em></li>\n<li><em>In November 2018 the International Space Station <strong>will have been orbiting</strong> Earth for 20 years.</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Making and using the future perfect continuous</h3>\n<p>We make this form with:</p>\n<p><strong>subject + 'll/will + 've/have + been + present participle (-ing form)</strong></p>\n<p>Negative</p>\n<p><strong>subject + won't + 've/have + been + present particple (-ing form)</strong></p>\n<h3><br>Time references</br></h3>\n<p>The future perfect continuous is generally used with two time references. One reference is to the specific time in the future. The other is to the duration of the activity up until that time in the future and uses an expression with <strong>for</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>By the time they get here</strong> I will have been working on it <strong>for nearly three months.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>In July</strong> we'll have been living in Dubai<strong> for two years.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Next week</strong> I'll have been studying here <strong>for six months</strong>.</em> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br/>To do</h3>\n<p>Try the future perfect continuous quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>In the next activity we look at some other uses of the future perfect continuous and compare it to the future perfect simple.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Not just the future</h3>\n<p>Despite its name the <strong>future perfect continuous</strong> can also be used <strong>to make assumptions</strong> about the present and past. </p>\n<p>What time does this example refer to?</p>\n<p>Mum is worried because the children haven't come home from school. They normally catch the bus and are home by now. She hears on the radio that the bus drivers have <strong>gone on strike</strong> so there are no buses. She assumes that the children will still be waiting at the bus stop. She says:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"All the buses have been cancelled because of the strike. I'm going to pick up the kids. They <strong>will have been waiting</strong> at the bus stop for ages.\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This example is about <strong>present time</strong>. Mum is <strong>making an assumption</strong> about what the children are doing and have been doing based on her knowledge of their behaviour. If she had received a phone call from them and she knew that they were waiting she would have said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"They've been waiting at the bus stop for ages.\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What about this example?</p>\n<p>Peter is a photo journalist who is writing a book about ancient monuments. Last week he visited the pyramids in Egypt but his friend, Raul, didn't know about the trip.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"Hey Raul, what was Peter doing in Egypt?\"<br>\"He <strong>will have been taking photos</strong> for his new book I guess, I'll give him a ring later and see how he got on.\"</br></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This example is about <strong>past time</strong>. Again though, it's an assumption and is not based on definite knowledge. If Raul knew for certain what Peter had been doing he would have used the past continuous:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"He was taking photos for his new book.\"</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Perfect or Continuous?</h3>\n<p>In <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-26/session-2\" target=\"_self\">Unit 26</a> </strong>you learned all about the <strong>future perfect simple</strong> verb form.</p>\n<p>The <strong>future perfect simple</strong> can describe an action that <strong>finishes</strong> before a time in the future. Imagine that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's 6 o'clock. </li>\n<li>We have dinner at 7 o'clock. We finish dinner by 7.30.</li>\n<li>Jan will get home at 8 o'clock.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Example: By the time Jan gets home <strong>we'll have had</strong> dinner.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The future perfect continuous emphasises that <strong>an action</strong> or <strong>a repeating series of actions</strong> started before a time in the future and is <strong>still happening</strong> at that time in the future. Imagine that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tomas started decorating the spare room weeks ago.</li>\n<li>He hasn't finished decorating yet.</li>\n<li>His parents are visiting in two weeks.</li>\n<li><em>Example: By the time his parents get here <strong>he will have been decorating</strong> the spare room for nearly three months.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><br/></em>The future perfect simple is about <strong>the result of an action</strong>, the future perfect continuous is more <strong>about the action itself</strong>.</p>\n<p>Just like with other verb forms, <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-25/session-2/activity-2\" target=\"_self\">state verbs</a></strong> are <strong>not normally used in the continuous form</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I will have known him for 25 years.</em> <strong>Correct</strong></li>\n<li><em>I will have been knowing him for 25 years</em>. <strong>Wrong</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Simple or continuous: can you work out which is the best answer in our quiz?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Do you feel confident using the future perfect continuous yet?

The streets of London are <strong>bracing themselves</strong> for an invasion of gorillas... and Santas!</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read this article which includes lots of examples of the future perfect continuous. The first time you read it, just try to answer the question: Are charity events like Tough Mudder very competitive, according to this article?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>On Saturday 17 September 2016, you may catch sight of hundreds of gorillas running around the streets of London. They’ll have been filming a new Planet of the Apes movie, you’ll probably think. But in fact, these giant apes will have been taking part in a charity event. When the starter's pistol sounds for the Great Gorilla Run next year, this highly popular event will have been raising money for thirteen years. People from all over the world will run, jog or walk 8km in gorilla costumes through the capital’s streets, passing such <strong>iconic</strong> landmarks as The Tower of London and St Paul’s Cathedral. By the time the last ape crosses the finishing line, the runners, who will have been collecting <strong>sponsorship</strong> for several weeks <strong>prior to</strong> the race, will have raised millions for <strong>endangered</strong> species and education projects in Central Africa.</p>\n<p>Unusual charity events such as these are a huge <strong>trend</strong> for raising money for <strong>worthwhile</strong> causes. If, however, you’re looking to support a charity in a more challenging way and you <strong>relish the idea</strong> of running through mud and freezing cold ice, then The Tough Mudder is perhaps what you've been searching for. In this <strong>gruelling</strong> team event, participants tackle a 10 to 12-mile obstacle course that tests physical strength and mental courage. It’s more about <strong>camaraderie</strong> than winning. Over 150 such events worldwide have raised £5 million.</p>\n<p>Christmas is traditionally a time for charity events: people <strong>sporting</strong> Santa outfits take part in Santa runs, and brave swimmers take to the freezing waters of the Serpentine on <strong>Boxing Day</strong> in London’s Hyde Park – some will have been taking part in this traditional festive <strong>dip</strong> for years.</p>\n<p>Other bizarre fundraising schemes by individuals include the attempt by Chris Todd, nicknamed the Hamster Man, to pedal a <strong>device</strong> like a huge hamster wheel across the Irish Sea to raise money for the blind and lifeboats. He abandoned the attempt after 23 of the 66 miles.</p>\n<p>But fundraising doesn’t have to involve physical <strong>exertion</strong>. Students at a school in Illinois played Justin Bieber’s song ‘Baby’ over loudspeakers and urged fellow students to pay to stop the song. They needed to raise $1,000 in one week to achieve this. They exceeded the goal within three days. Even teachers <strong>chipped in</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you want to join the ranks of gorillas next September, you only have to pay £60 to register. This includes the gorilla suit, which you can keep. If you take part, not only will you have been helping the gorillas and people who depend on their habitat, you’ll never have to buy another fancy dress costume again!</p>\n<h3>Answer</h3>\n<p>Are charity events like Tough Mudder very competitive, according to this article? No - they're \"more about camaraderie than winning\".</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now read the article again and try to answer the questions in the 'Monkey Business' quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session. In Session 4, hear about BBC Learning English's ambitious plan to broadcast non-stop for 24 hours, not just 6 minutes!</p></div>",

I was doing some last minute preparation.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> In bed?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn</strong><br/> Eh?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> Never mind – glad you’re here. Now, are you ready?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn</strong><br/> Well, I’ve been trying to rest my voice.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/>Ah, so that’s why it’s been so nice and quiet in the office recently, eh!<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> And I’m sure you’ll have been checking your scripts.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn</strong><br/> Yes - I have been.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> Great.

Let’s go through some key points. Now Finn, by two o’clock you’ll have been broadcasting for four hours. Do you think you can keep going that long without a break?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Well I won’t have been talking for all that time, will I? I mean, there's, there’ll be music and interviews as well, won’t there?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> Sure. How long before you think you will need a rest.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>I think about four o’clock. We’ll have been on the air for six hours by then.<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>More importantly, the poor audience will have been listening to your voice for that long! They’ll need a rest as well.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Ha ha, thanks for that Rob!<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>You’re welcome.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>And then it’s you Rob, you’ll be doing the next six hours, up to 10. What will you have been doing to get ready?<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Well in all likelyhood I will have been relaxing with my feet up somewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Will you have been paying attention to the broadcast?<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Erm, maybe?<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Because you need to know what’s been happening so you don’t repeat anything and so you can pick up where Finn leaves off.<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>OK. well in that case, I will have been relaxing with my feet up - and my ear glued to the programme.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum</strong><br/> Great. At 10 it’s back to you Finn, then every six hours, swap between you and Rob. How does that sound?<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Tiring!<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>By the end you both will have been talking for 12 hours and we will have been transmitting non-stop for 24. <br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And I’m sure I’ll have drunk more coffee than I have in my whole life - just to keep me awake.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Yes, but think of the glory - we'll have been breaking new ground for BBC Learning English, and passing new milestones.<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob<br/> </strong>I think with all that coffee I will've been passing a lot more than milestones by the end.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Eew, that's more information than I needed.<br/> <br/> <strong>Callum<br/> </strong>Right, OK everyone, are we ready?
