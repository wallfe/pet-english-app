        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about hyphenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hyphens are those little signs – like dashes – that we use in writing to join two words together.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, like in <strong>old-fashioned. </strong>There's always a hyphen between<strong> old </strong>and <strong>fashioned. </strong>Let's start with a clip from Brian. He's a news reporter, and he's reporting from a high school about an election.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Think about this question while you're listening: How does Brian describe the young people at the school? Here's Brian.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at <strong>this secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election. They're all <strong>hard-working </strong>young people. <strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision. But a sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date</strong>. Back to the studio.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we asked you: How does Brian describe the young people at the school?  </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: He says they are <strong>hard-working.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That means they work hard. Now there are lots of compound adjectives like <strong>hard-working</strong> that we make with an adjective or adverb like <strong>hard</strong> plus a present participle like <strong>working</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we always write them with a hyphen. So <strong>hard hyphen working</strong> (hard-working).</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we can make compound adjectives in other ways too. Listen to this clip for three more examples.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at this<strong> secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election. <strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>First we had <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> <strong>students</strong>. <strong>Eighteen-year-old</strong> is an adjective made from three words joined together with hyphens. When we write age before a noun, we use hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Eighteen hyphen year hyphen old</strong> (eighteen-year-old)<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with numbers; for example, we write the phrase <strong>a two-door car</strong> like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>A two hyphen door car</strong> (a two-door car)<strong>. </strong>But that's only for numbers <strong>before</strong> the noun. If you write: <strong>the students are eighteen years old</strong>, you don't need hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, the second compound in that clip was <strong>twenty-two</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the rule is: always use hyphens in numbers from <strong>twenty-one</strong> to <strong>ninety-nine</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Twenty hyphen one </strong>(twenty-one). Two hundred and <strong>ninety hyphen nine </strong>(two hundred and ninety-nine).</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good. Now the last compound adjective we had there was <strong>last-minute. </strong>The students were going to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that's the adjective <strong>last</strong> plus the noun <strong>minute</strong>, joined with a hyphen. Now for another clip. Listen out for some more compound adjectives.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>A sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Well respected. </strong>That's an adverb, <strong>well</strong>, and the past participle of a verb, <strong>respected</strong>. And together, they make an adjective, and the two parts of the adjective need a hyphen when we write them before a noun.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's a<strong> well-respected politician</strong>, with a hyphen: <strong>well hyphen respected politician </strong>(well-respected politician).</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. But in a phrase like <strong>the politicians were well respected </strong>we don't use a hyphen, because the adjective comes after the noun, not before. And that rule is the same for three-word compound adjectives like <strong>out-of-date</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, the phrase<strong> out-of-date attitudes</strong> has hyphens because the adjective is before the noun, but the phrase <strong>their attitudes are out of date</strong> doesn't have hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And one last rule is that we never use hyphens in compound adjectives that have an adverb which ends in <strong>-l-y</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, we don't. So in phrases like<strong> a carefully written letter</strong> we don't use hyphens.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's talk about <strong>compound</strong> <strong>nouns</strong>. In our clip, Brian was reporting from a secondary school. The phrase <strong>s</strong><strong>econdary school</strong> is a compound noun - and there's no hyphen in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, there isn't. Most compound nouns are written as two separate words.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If you're not sure, check in a good dictionary. </p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Number one: What's the compound adjective in this sentence and does it need a hyphen? <strong>We were late because of the slow-moving traffic.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Slow-moving</strong> is the compound adjective, and it needs a hyphen.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Very good! And number two. Is there a hyphen in <strong>a forty-mile run</strong>? </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, there is. <strong>Forty hyphen mile run</strong> (forty-mile run)<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: <strong>The teacher was very well liked</strong>. Is there a hyphen in <strong>well liked</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We don't need a hyphen there.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done if you got those right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. When you are reading, make a note of compound adjectives and nouns with - and without - hyphens. Keep a list and check it regularly.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>  </strong><strong> <br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>In this programme we're talking about present tenses. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>Now let's get started. The first thing we need to know is that the present simple tense is mainly for facts, habits and truths. Now, Catherine, give me a true fact about you.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>A true fact about me is that I like gardening.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh, wow, great.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Love it.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Thanks Catherine. And can you tell me one of your habits?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>I drink a cup of coffee every morning. I drink one at home and I drink another one when I get to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So far so good. We make the present simple with a subject and base verb, and we add <strong>-s</strong> to the verb for <strong>he</strong>, <strong>she</strong> and <strong>it</strong>. So: I work, you work, he works, she works, and so on. We make questions and negatives with <strong>do</strong> or <strong>does</strong>. So Catherine, do you take milk in your coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>I do take milk in my coffee, Finn. Do you take milk in your coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>            <br/>I don't. I like it black.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And what about Mrs Finn, does she take milk in her coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She doesn't drink coffee.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, what does she drink?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Tea. All the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very British.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Good. So that's present simple for facts and habits. Now when we're talking about activities, temporary situations, and things that are happening now – or around now – we use <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is</strong> or <strong>are </strong>plus an <strong>i-n-g verb</strong> to make the present continuous. So Finn, what are you doing now?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, right now, right at this minute, I'm sitting in the studio, on a chair, talking to you, but off and on, I'm also reading a novel called The Unconsoled by Kazuo Ishiguro. It's great.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well pronounced.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Thank you. And are you reading anything right now Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes I am. I'm reading a novel also. It's a comedy about Adrian Mole and it's really good, I'm enjoying it a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Sounds great. I'd like to borrow it.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You can. We can also use the present continuous for future arrangements. So Finn, what are you doing tonight?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Tonight I'm taking my wife to dinner. Don't tell her.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Lucky wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right. So, present simple for facts and habits; present continuous for activities and future arrangements.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And now for the present perfect. We make it with <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> plus the past participle, it connects the past to the present, and it's useful for asking about life experiences. So, life experience question coming, Finn. Have you ever eaten insects?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>            <br/>I have, yes. I've eaten ants and beetles in Cambodia. So in the question, the word <strong>ever</strong> means 'at any time in your life'. <strong>Never</strong> means at no time in your life. So Catherine, tell us about an experience that you have <strong>never</strong> had. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I've never eaten insects Finn. And I've never been on safari. But I'm sure that our colleague Rob has been on safari.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He's been to many places.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>He has. Other words we use with present perfect are <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong>. We use <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong> a lot when we're using the present perfect tense to talk about the present effect of a past event. <strong>Already</strong> means something has happened, perhaps earlier than expected. So Finn, give us an example of <strong>already</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. I've <strong>already</strong> had breakfast today.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>And coffee? Have you had coffee?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>I've <strong>just</strong> had a cup of coffee. <strong>Just</strong> means recently. I haven't had lunch <strong>yet</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I should think not, it's only half ten.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It's a bit early for lunch, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And <strong>yet</strong> means something like 'not until now'.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn            <br/></strong>Good. And if a past situation has continued until now, use <strong>for</strong> or <strong>since</strong> to say how long it has continued, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>I've lived in London <strong>for</strong> five years. I've been married <strong>since</strong> 2003.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We also use the present perfect to give news. Things that happened a short time ago, and are important now. So, have you got any news for us, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Yes I have, actually. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I've won the lottery!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I don't believe you.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's because I'm not telling the truth, it's just an example!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And we're talking about present tenses. And it's quiz time! Question one. Which of these sentences best describes a habit? a) I have smoked 20 cigarettes a day, b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And the answer's b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day. Question two. Is this sentence grammatically correct, or wrong? Humans have not visited the planet Mars yet, but they have already been to the moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It's correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It is. Now, last one: Which sentence is correct? a) Catherine has never eaten insects, b) Catherine never eats insects, or c) Catherine is never eating insects.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is that both a) and b) are correct. As a life experience it's true to say that I have never eaten insects; and as a fact I can say: I never eat insects. So that brings us to the end of the quiz, and well done to you if you got them all right.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>            <br/>A free insect for everyone who got all of those right!

Shops, <strong>warehouses</strong> and offices were left <strong>vacant</strong> when they stopped <strong>trading</strong>.</p>\n<p>But what happened to all these empty buildings? Here's an article on the pop-up <strong>craze </strong>in many towns and cities in the UK.</p>\n<p>While you're reading the first time, decide which is the best summary of the story.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-ups are shops that will save the high street.</li>\n<li>Pop-ups allow people freedom when they set up a business.</li>\n<li>Pop-ups have no risks when they are started.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Perfect pop-ups</h3>\n<p><strong>What is a 'pop-up'?</strong></p>\n<p>Pop-up shops first <strong>popped up</strong> in the UK in the early 2000s, with the economy <strong>booming</strong> and the high streets <strong>bustling</strong>. They were originally a way for small, <strong>niche</strong> companies to rent <strong>retail space</strong> in great locations. This was while <strong>landlords</strong> who owned these spaces looked for permanent <strong>tenants</strong>. Pop-up shops can take a number of different forms. They might be temporary shops in the high street or a shopping centre. They might be simple <strong>market stalls.</strong> They could be based in some kind of transport, like a food truck. Or they could be run by people who visit different establishments, like travelling chefs who take over pub and restaurant kitchens temporarily.</p>\n<p>Almost anything that can be on a high street can also be a pop-up. There have been pop-up shops, art galleries, theatres, cinemas and restaurants among others!</p>\n<p><strong>Why are pop-ups becoming so popular?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For <strong>would-be</strong> pop-up entrepreneurs, the appeal of this temporary shopping concept is clear. They can start a business with much lower risk. There are fewer <strong>overheads</strong>, such as paying wages or heating and lighting for their <strong>premises</strong>. The temporary nature of a pop-up gives the opportunity to test a product and develop a <strong>customer base</strong>, without being tied in to a long-term renting contract. Being small, with <strong>minimal</strong> staff, makes it much easier for pop-ups to <strong>expand</strong> if they are successful.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pop-up shops are a way for landlords to fill up empty property they may have. When the economy took a <strong>downturn</strong> after 2008, many shops became vacant after they <strong>went out of business</strong>. It makes sense for landlords to be able to allow people to come in and set up a temporary shop as a <strong>stopgap</strong> and use the available space.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you look at the business sector, pop-ups make a lot of sense. According to a 2014 report by the Centre of Economic and Business Research, the pop-up industry was worth £2.1bn and is expected to grow by 8.4% in 2015. Charles Davis of the CEBR also said that the pop-up sector \"is growing faster than the overall retail sector.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the future like for pop-up shops?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With banks remaining <strong>reluctant</strong> to lend money to new businesses and landlords still with lots of empty <strong>units</strong> to fill, there seems to be a future for pop-up shops in towns and city centres. There is also the threat of online shopping, which means that anyone can buy anything they want without leaving their home. If high streets all feature the same selection of shops, there is no variety. Pop-up shops add <strong>vibrancy</strong> to the high street and make it different and distinctive.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you work out which was the best summary of the article? Here is the answer:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-ups are shops that will save the high street. (No. Pop-ups can take many forms: shops, cinemas, restaurants and more. They might benefit the high street, but they might not save it completely.)</li>\n<li>Pop-ups allow people freedom when they set up a business. (Yes. Starting a pop-up can mean few overheads or expenses for the people who set them up.)</li>\n<li>Pop-ups have no risks when they are started. (No. Pop-ups might have a lower risk than traditional businesses, but there is still some risk.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Did you understand the article?

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Hi, this is Finn and I've got some special language for you today. And how about this: I might even save you some money! Learn English and save money? Well, today we're talking about haggling – now that's what we do when we're trying to buy something for a cheaper price – like at a market, or on holiday.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Haggling is, of course, very common in many different cultures, and here in the UK people do haggle but they don't really do it in big shops: you might hear it, maybe, at a market – or, as we're going to hear – if you're buying something expensive like a second-hand car.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Now, Rob is looking for a good deal. But will Neil – who's selling – be happy with the price? Let's listen. And while you do, listen out for a particular phrase – instead of saying 'could you sell it for...', what does Rob say?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Excuse me. How much for the Vauxhall over there?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Oh the Vauxhall, oh yeah, that's a <strong>bargain.</strong> £700. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>700?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Yeah. It'll cost you at least 800 anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>Could you do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>500? No, sorry, no: I can sell this car for 700, I'm sure of it.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I've got the cash. <strong>You couldn't do it for 550?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>No. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do a bit cheaper, could you?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Well, I tell you what, <strong>I could probably do it for about 650.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Ok, let's pause their haggling right there. Did you hear the phrase Rob used? Instead of saying 'Could you sell it for £500', Rob said:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/></span></span><span><span><strong>Could you do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Do it. Simple, huh? <strong>Could you</strong> <strong>do it for</strong> <strong>500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>Could you</strong> <strong>do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>You could also say <strong>Can you do it for</strong> <strong>£500</strong> – <strong>can</strong> rather than <strong>could.</strong> But <strong>could</strong> is a little bit more polite. Now listen to these examples of it as well – you can use it in the negative, with <strong>couldn't:</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do it for</strong> <strong>550? </strong></span></span><span><span><strong>You couldn't do it a</strong> <strong>bit cheaper, could you?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do it for 550? You couldn't do a bit cheaper, could you?</strong> Now remember, haggling goes both ways – and the seller will use lots of language to keep the price high. So did you notice the language Neil used – he called it a <strong>bargain</strong> – that's a good price, and said it would cost more in other shops.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Oh the Vauxhall, oh yeah, that's a <strong>bargain</strong>. £700. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>700?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It'll cost you at least 800 anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>But Rob is persistent – he doesn't give up! He's succeeded in getting the price down by £50 already. You could say – Neil has <strong>knocked off</strong> £50. Now, <strong>knocked off</strong> means he's taken the price down by £50. Now, let's listen to the end of their conversation – the end of their haggling. How much does Neil <strong>knock off</strong> in the end?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>I tell you what, <strong>I could probably do it for about 650.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>650?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>650, yeah. <strong>You can't say fairer than that.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Well, is that really your best price?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It's my best price. 650. Come on.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I've got all the cash here. I haven’t got 650, I've got 600. I'll give you 600 for it.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>630, how about that? I've just <strong>knocked off</strong> another £20.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>It's too much: <strong>I haven’t got that kind of money</strong>. Look, I saw it down the road for 600. In fact, I think I might go there and buy it. Thanks anyway, bye.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Hang on, hang on, let's not be <strong>silly</strong> here. Let's not be silly here. I'll tell you what. 600.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>600. It's a deal.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>So how much did Neil <strong>knock off</strong>? Well the final price was £600, and it started at £700 – so he <strong>knocked off</strong> £100. How did Rob do this? Well, he used another good phrase: <strong>I haven’t got that kind of money.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/></span></span><span><span>It's too much: <strong>I haven’t got that kind of money</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>And he also did something I always do if I'm haggling and I can't get the price down – he started to walk away.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I saw it down the road for 600. In fact, I think I might go there and buy it. Thanks anyway, bye.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Hang on, hang on...</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>It's a bit naughty, isn't it - but it tends to work! Anyway, finally they reached a deal. And what did Neil say at the very end?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>600.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>600. It's a deal.</p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong> You'll often hear this in spoken English – in a haggling situation like this, so if you hear it, well done – your haggling has been successful, and it's time to pay up!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong><br/>600.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/></span></span><span><span>600. It's a deal.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/><strong>Go on then.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>That's it for this time, but let me know if you manage to use any of this language next time you haggle. You might even save some money. I'll leave you with their conversation one last time.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Excuse me. How much for the Vauxhall over there?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>Oh the Vauxhall, oh yeah, that's a <strong>bargain.</strong> £700. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>700?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It'll cost you at least 800 anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>Could you do it for 500?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>500? No, sorry, no: I can sell this car for 700, I'm sure of it.<br/></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I've got the cash. <strong>You couldn't do it for 550?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>No. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/><strong>You couldn't do a bit cheaper, could you?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>I'll tell you what, <strong>I could probably do it for 650.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>650?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>650, yeah. <strong>You can't say fairer than that.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Well, is that really your best price?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>It's my best price. 650.

We use it with <strong>can/can't</strong> and <strong>could/couldn't</strong>:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>I <strong>can</strong> probably <strong>do it for</strong> about £650.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><span><span><strong><em>Can't</em></strong><em> you <strong>do it a bit cheaper</strong>?</em></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><strong><em>Could</em></strong><em> you <strong>do it for </strong>500?</em></span></span></li>\n<li><em><span><span>You <strong>couldn't do it</strong> <strong>for</strong> £550?</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>2. </span></strong><strong><span><span>To 'knock off'</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span><span>This phrasal verb means 'lower the price'.</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>Can you <strong>knock off</strong> another £30?</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>I could <strong>knock off</strong> £10 for you.</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span><strong>3. When you've got a deal:</strong> <strong>'Go on then'</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>To show that the price is agreed, it sounds very natural in spoken English for the buyer and/or the seller to say: <strong>Go on then</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>Buyer: £600?</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>Seller: <strong>Go on then</strong>.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>Buyer: I'll give you £40 for it.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>Seller: <strong>Go on then</strong>.</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Next</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span></span>Now – can you use these expressions to haggle? Let's find out in the next activity, as you try to buy a camera at a bargain price.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Can you do it a bit cheaper?</h3>\n<p>Learning about haggling would be no fun without the chance to practise! So, now it's time to put our haggling language to good use.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong></strong>To do</h3>\n<p>Imagine you're at a pop-up market and you've seen a camera you really like. It's a vintage one - very stylish! All your friends will be jealous. But first, you have to buy it - and the seller wants too much. He wants £100, but you only want to spend £50. Answer the questions in our haggling quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>Well done: you're now a professional haggler! That's all for this session.

I'm Neil...</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>A very smart Neil - and I'm Catherine. Why are you wearing a suit, Neil? You're looking very smart for work.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes you're right, I am wearing a suit because I'm going to a wedding<strong> at one o'clock</strong>!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! I love weddings.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I love weddings too. I'm going to another one <strong>on Saturday</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Fantastic Neil. And<strong> at </strong>and <strong>on</strong> are two of the words we’re discussing in today's programme...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, because we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We'll explain why we say <strong><span>at</span></strong> <strong>one o'clock </strong>but <strong><span>on</span> Saturday.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span>    <br/>Yes, and we'll give you lots of examples.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Let's start by listening to Mike and Rob. They are trying to find a time to meet up.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Think about this question while you listen: what time can Rob meet Mike?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well... I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hmm... the engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. The washing machine's flooded <span>again!</span> It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Well, what are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sorry - I'm playing football.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend. </strong>How about this afternoon <strong>at two thirty</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So, we asked you: What time can Rob meet Mike? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: <strong>at two thirty.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>When we say a particular time on the clock, we use <strong>at</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, we say <strong>at two thirty, at three o'clock.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>at</strong> in other time expressions. Listen out for them in this clip.  </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 1       </strong><span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well… I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hmm… The engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. The washing machine's flooded <span>again!</span> It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So Rob had a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong>It's<strong> at </strong>because it’s a time<strong>. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. We also heard <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. We use <strong>at</strong> with particular points during the day, like mealtimes, so it's <strong>at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and also we say <strong>at noon</strong>,<strong> at midnight</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now Rob said his washing machine flooded <strong>at Easter</strong>. We use <strong>at</strong> to talk about a special day or group of days. So, it’s<strong> at Easter, at New Year.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>At Christmas. So that's <strong>at</strong>. Let’s look at <strong>on</strong>. We use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week. So: <strong>on Monday,</strong> <strong>on Tuesday</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>on</strong> with specific dates: <strong>on the third of May, on June the 20th</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>…and we use <strong>on</strong> with specific days: <strong>on Christmas Day, on Easter Sunday, on my birthday</strong>!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But remember it's<strong> <span>at</span> Easter, <span>at</span> Christmas </strong>when we are referring to the general time period.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen to another clip with more time expressions. Listen out for the time expression with <strong>in</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2</span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>What are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sorry - I'm playing football.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend. </strong>How about this afternoon<strong> at two thirty?</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>in the afternoon</strong>. We use <strong>in</strong> with parts of the day, so it's <strong>in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>But did you notice that it's<strong> on Saturday evening. </strong>If we use a day of the week plus <strong>morning, afternoon</strong> or <strong>evening, </strong>we use <strong>on</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>in</strong> with seasons, so it's<strong> in spring, in the winter. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>in</strong> with months and years, so it's <strong>in June, in 1996.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>Notice also that Rob said <strong>at the weekend</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Rob speaks British English so he used <strong>at the weekend</strong>. Some other speakers will say <strong>on the weekend</strong>. It's perfectly fine.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, to recap, we use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week, dates and special days.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use<strong> at </strong>with times and particular points in the day.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>British people say <strong>at the weekend. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we also say <strong>at</strong> with festivals<strong>.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>in</strong> for seasons, months and years. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And now for a quiz.

And what's Mike doing <strong>in the afternoon</strong>?</p>\n<p>In 6 Minute Vocabulary we're looking at time expressions with the words <strong>in, at</strong> and <strong>on.</strong> Neil and Catherine are your guides - and they have lots of top tips to help you remember.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-2/downloads\" target=\"_self\">Unit 2 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/6min_vocab\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, do you think you know how to use <strong>in, at</strong> and <strong>on</strong> with time expressions now? Would you like a chance to demonstrate your ability? Well, try the activities on the next two pages.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Time to show off your knowledge</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to test how well you understood the rules about using <strong>in</strong>, <strong>on</strong> and <strong>at</strong> with time expressions. We want you to complete a conversation between two friends. Misha and Surya live in different countries and haven't seen each other for a long time. Misha is thinking about visiting Surya at her home in the mountains.</p>\n<h3> </h3></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Fill the gaps with the correct prepositions. Also, while you read, try to answer this question: When does Misha decide to fly?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>How did you get on? If you didn't get them all right, have another try. And do you know when Misha decided to fly? It was on Friday 3rd April at 7pm.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done for completing that quiz. Those time expressions were quite simple - but what about time expressions with two parts - like <strong>Saturday morning</strong>? Do we say <strong>at</strong>,<strong> in</strong> or <strong>on</strong>? Find out and then do another quiz, next!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Some extra tips</h3>\n<p>So, you've done one activity about <strong>in</strong>,<strong> at</strong>, and <strong>on</strong>. But what about when things are not so clear?</p>\n<h3> </h3></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Tip 1 - On Saturday night</strong></h3>\n<p>Look at this sentence. Should <strong>in, on</strong> or <strong>at</strong> go in the gap?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We're meeting __ Saturday night.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We would normally say <strong>on</strong> Saturday and <strong>at</strong> night. So should it be <strong>on</strong> – for Saturday – or <strong>at</strong> – for night? The answer is:</p>\n<p>We're meeting <strong>on</strong> Saturday night.</p>\n<p>We use the preposition <strong>on</strong> even though there is another time expression afterwards.</p>\n<h3>Tip 2 - On Christmas morning</h3>\n<p>Why do you think we use <strong>on</strong> in this sentence?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What did you do <strong>on Christmas morning</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Normally we use <strong>at</strong> for festivals like Christmas and we use <strong>in</strong> for parts of the day like the morning, but Christmas Day is actually a specific day, rather than a whole festival, so we use <strong>on</strong>. Again, we use the preposition <strong>on</strong> even though there is another time expression afterwards.</p>\n<h3>Tip 3 - No preposition</h3>\n<p>Finally, <strong>in</strong>, <strong>at</strong> and <strong>on</strong> are not generally used before the words <strong>today, tomorrow </strong>and<strong> yesterday</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't go <strong>tomorrow</strong></li>\n<li>He wrote that article <strong>yesterday</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't use <strong>in, on</strong> or <strong>at</strong> in time expressions with the words <strong>this, that, next, last, all, one, each, some and every:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I slept<strong> all day</strong></li>\n<li>He didn't come<strong> last night</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now, use the information from the whole of this session to answer the questions in this quiz. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session.

It started raining in the morning, continued raining and it’s still raining now.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We can also use the present perfect continuous for actions that have recently finished. An example, please Finn.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I’ve got paint all over my clothes because I’ve been decorating the living room.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, so Finn's got paint all over his clothes, and that's the evidence he was painting but now he's finished. Another example please, Finn:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Joe! Where have you been? I’ve been trying to get hold of you… I’ve got some bad news.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So, Finn has finally managed to find Joe. The action of looking for Joe has finished but Finn was looking right up until the moment he found him. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>To say how long an action has been happening for, we can add a time expression.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Jack has got a big concert tomorrow. He’s been rehearsing <strong>all day</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>We’ve been going to the same hotel<strong> for the last ten years</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Earlier, Finn said: it has been raining<strong> since 9 o’clock this morning</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>For three hours, for the last ten years </strong>and<strong> since 9 o’clock this morning</strong> tell us how long the activity has been happening. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The present perfect continuous is often used with the words <strong>already</strong> and <strong>just</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, we can use <strong>already </strong>if an action hasn’t finished, and we want to emphasise how long it’s been happening. Finn:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>She’s <strong>alread</strong>y been sleeping for three hours.</span></p>\n<p><span>This chicken has <strong>already</strong> been cooking for two hours.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>just</strong> when the action has already finished - and we want to emphasise how recently it finished.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There’s Yasemin – I’ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband on the phone!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We can also use <strong>recently </strong>or <strong>lately</strong> to say that a situation or action finished only a short while ago, but they are a little further back in time than <strong>just</strong>. So, Neil, have you been doing anything special recently…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I’ve been trying to lose a bit of weight recently, so I’ve been going to the gym after work. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>It's starting to show a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. How about you, Catherine…?</p>\n<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, I’m afraid I haven't been going to the gym because I’ve been feeling rather tired lately and I haven’t been sleeping very well.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You’ve been working too hard! Now, we form the present perfect continuous with the <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb. Here are some examples:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Jack has been working hard.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s been raining …</span></p>\n<p><span>I’ve been reading that book …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And for negatives, it’s <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>haven’t</strong> or <strong>hasn’t </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I haven’t been sleeping very well.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We usually put <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> between <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong>. So it’s She’s <strong>already</strong> been sleeping for three hours.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>…</strong>and I’ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband ….</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>But time expressions usually go after the main verb. So it’s Jack’s been studying <strong>all day</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And don’t forget to use short forms like <strong>I’ve… It’s… haven’t… hasn’t </strong>with the present perfect continuous.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine <br/></span></strong><span>And we're talking about the present perfect continuous. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We use it to talk about an activity that started in the past and is continuing now or has recently finished.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we often use it with the adverbs <strong>just </strong>and<strong> already</strong>, and with other time expressions like <strong>recently</strong> and<strong> lately</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Time for our quiz. Number one. Which is correct? The chicken only needs another fifteen minutes. It's a) …already been cooking for two hours, or b) It’s just been cooking for two hours. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And that's a) because the chicken is still cooking.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number 2. a) Where have you been? I wait for you for half an hour. b) Where have you been? I’ve been waiting for you for half an hour. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It’s b) because you use the present perfect continuous to say how long you have been doing an action. </p>\n<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Finally, number 3. a) You’ve been listening just to 6 minute grammar. b) You’ve just been listening to 6 minute grammar.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>It’s b) because <strong>just</strong> goes between the auxiliary <strong>have</strong> and <strong>been</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Correct and it’s the end of the show. There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

Or do you think they are a bit <strong>past it</strong>?</p>\n<p>If you think they are not as good as they used to be, you may not be alone. Some people think the <strong>format</strong> needs a big <strong>shake-up</strong> and are looking for alternatives to the traditional panel of judges. Scientists at the University of Sussex think they have come up with a solution - and you can read more about it in this article.</p>\n<p>While you're reading, try to decide which of these is the best summary of the story:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A computer program might replace TV talent show judges.</li>\n<li>Computers can match the performance of human judges.</li>\n<li>A team from America is making computerised talent show judges.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Talent shows: from human judges to computers</h3>\n<p>Most of us will be familiar with the traditional talent show set up: thousands of <strong>hopefuls</strong> lining up outside the audition room, ready for their shot at stardom. After they have been waiting for hours and hours, they go in and perform for a <strong>panel</strong> of judges. Then these <strong>wannabe</strong> popstars could be lucky and get through to the next round, or they might hear the line, \"Sorry, it's a 'no' from me\". But what do the judges actually bring to a talent show?</p>\n<p>Music talent show judges attract millions of viewers each week to their programmes. Their high public profile can make them an important part of advertising campaigns for these programmes. But they often receive high salaries and can be <strong>temperamental</strong>. Are they really worth the expense and difficulties that they can cause? One solution might be to replace them with computers.</p>\n<p>Can computers really match human judges, with their general musical knowledge and <strong>ear for </strong>a tune? Scientist Dr Nick Collins and his team at the University of Sussex think they can. Dr Collings has been working on a project that involves programming three computerised judges that he says would be far more <strong>consistent</strong> in their judgement of musical performances. Using a highly <strong>versatile programming language</strong>, Dr Collins's digital judges can be trained up by 'listening' to particular musical <strong>genres</strong>. After they have been listening for a while, the programming language allows these judges to spot the specific features of the music. It takes eight hours to train the electronic judges in this way. During this time they analyse lots of information about each track they listen to, including the pitch, the <strong>timbre</strong> of the music, the rhythm and the way the tracks change over time.</p>\n<p>Collins even says that the \"judges also have <strong>pet hates</strong> and <strong>guilty pleasures</strong>\" and that he \"can't anticipate how they will turn out\". He adds, \"The judges' listening capacity is not yet <strong>on a par with</strong> a human ear\" but that they won't be as annoying as some human reality TV show judges.</p>\n<p>And maybe that is the problem with this electronic musical innovation. Real human judges on talent shows interest us with their personality, decisions and <strong>catchphrases</strong>. Will a computer program be able to do the same?</p>\n<p>For more information about these computer talent show judges, you can read this <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17735551\" target=\"_self\">original BBC News story</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>So, did you work out which was the best summary of the article?</strong></p>\n<p>It was 'A computer program might replace TV talent show judges.' You can find out why the other possible summaries were wrong in our quiz.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>How well did you understand the article?

Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>? How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad? Do you need to get some <strong>advice</strong> from your bank? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport? </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that was Colin. We asked you: What might you need from your bank before you go abroad?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And the answer is: You might need some <strong>advice</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right: <strong>some advice</strong>.<strong> Advice</strong> means ideas and suggestions about what to do. Now, did you notice that <strong>advice </strong>is not plural? We never say <strong>advices</strong> in English because <strong>advice</strong> is an uncountable noun. You can't make <strong>advice</strong> plural, like you can in some other languages.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And with uncountable nouns, we don't use articles <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong>. We say <strong>some advice</strong>, not<strong> an advice</strong>. Now listen out for three more uncountable nouns in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Colin<br/></strong></span>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>! Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>?</p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the uncountable nouns in that clip were: <strong>travel, research</strong> and <strong>accommodation</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And activities like <strong>travel, work</strong> and <strong>homework</strong> are usually uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Information words like <strong>research</strong>,<strong> information</strong> and <strong>advice</strong> are uncountable too. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they're not usually plural in English, but we can add the words <strong>a piece of </strong>to lots of uncountable nouns if we like. So we can say <strong>a piece of information </strong>or<strong> two pieces of advice.  </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. The other uncountable noun in that clip was <strong>accommodation</strong>.<strong> Accommodation </strong>means 'places to live or spend the night', like rooms, flats and houses. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>accommodation</strong> describes the groups of places that you can stay like flats, houses, students halls of residence. And group words are often uncountable, so there's no plural form. <strong>Fruit</strong>,<strong> food</strong> and <strong>weather</strong> are group words too. We don't usually say <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>foods</strong> and <strong>weathers</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>That's right. Now, let's have another clip. Can you spot any more uncountable nouns?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>baggage</strong>,<strong> money </strong>and<strong> traffic</strong>. In some languages these words are often plural...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>...but not in English. In English, they are all group words.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. So<strong> baggage </strong>means a group of bags...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's<strong> money </strong>for coins or notes...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>traffic</strong> for cars, lorries, buses.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we're talking about uncountable nouns. We've seen that some activity nouns are uncountable, and some group nouns are uncountable. Shall we now talk about more types of uncountable nouns, Catherine?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Go on then. So we've got liquids and gases. <strong>Water</strong> and <strong>air </strong>are uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they are. Materials and substances like <strong>wood </strong>and <strong>salt</strong> are uncountable too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Then there are words for feelings and ideas, so <strong>happiness</strong> and <strong>education</strong>...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And also subjects like <strong>history</strong> and <strong>biology</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But be careful with subjects like <strong>physics</strong> or <strong>economics</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they end with the letter <strong>-s,</strong> so they look plural, but in fact they're usually uncountable too. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So we use them with a singular verb, just like other uncountable nouns. Physics <strong>is</strong> complicated...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>...and Economics <strong>isn't</strong> easy.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/><strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it's quiz time! Number one: Is the word <strong>furniture</strong> countable or uncountable?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is - it's uncountable. It's a group word like <strong>baggage</strong>. It means things like tables and chairs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Very good. And number two: is this sentence correct or wrong? Please can you give me some informations?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>That is not correct. <strong>Information</strong> is uncountable so it's <strong>some information</strong> without an -<strong>s</strong>, not <strong>some informations</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine.<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! And the last one: Which is correct: a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday. Or b) it was a beautiful weather on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The answer's a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done to you if you got them all right.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But before we go, here's a tip. When you see a noun, think carefully about whether it belongs to one of these types: activity words, information words or group words. If it does, then it's probably uncountable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme we're talking about the words <strong>all, every, each, both, either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...also known as quantifiers. So let's start by listening to Darren. He's been talking about how to choose a tablet.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Why do customers have difficulty choosing a tablet?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT <br/></strong><strong>Darren<br/></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one? <strong>All</strong> customers choosing a tablet ask themselves that question because <strong>each</strong> tablet is slightly different. Take the Apik 1 and the Negus 2. <strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter. This could make a difference <strong>every </strong>time you go out. <strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. And then there’s the cost. While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That was Darren. So we asked you: Why do buyers have difficulty choosing tablets?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: Because <strong>each</strong> tablet has slightly different features.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now <strong>each</strong>,<strong> every</strong> and <strong>all</strong> can mean the full amount or total number of something. So we could also say <strong>every tablet </strong>or <strong>all tablets</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Each</strong> and <strong>every </strong>are followed by a singular noun and verb. We say <strong>each tablet has </strong>and<strong> every tablet</strong> <strong>has</strong> - but <strong>all</strong> is followed by a plural noun and verb, so it’s <strong>all tablets have</strong>. We could also say <strong>all the tablets have</strong>, but we don’t use <strong>the</strong> with <strong>each</strong> or <strong>every</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. There’s also a slight difference in meaning between <strong>every</strong> and <strong>each</strong>. We often use <strong>each</strong> when we're thinking about the individual members of a group.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. So to talk about about the features of individual tablets, Darren said <strong>each tablet</strong>. But here's what he said later on.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Darren<br/></strong>This could make a difference <strong>every time</strong> you go out.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There he's thinking about all the times, not individual times.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Listen for more quantifiers in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Darren      <br/></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one? <strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There we heard the words <strong>either</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>, or as some people say, <strong>either</strong>, <strong>neither</strong>, and <strong>both.</strong> We use these quantifiers to talk about two people or things. So in the phrase <strong>Both tablets have similar specs, Both tablets</strong> means <strong>this tablet and the other tablet</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>Neither tablet is heavy</strong>. That means <strong>not this one and not the other one</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Darren asked: <strong>Should you have either this one or that one?</strong> <strong>Either</strong> is used mainly in questions and negatives, to indicate a choice between two, or sometimes more than two, options.  </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Let's take a quick look at the verbs we use after <strong>both</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>. Listen. <strong>Both the tablets have </strong>similar specs. <strong>Neither tablet is </strong>heavy.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So after <strong>both</strong>, the verb is positive and plural – <strong>have</strong>. But after <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>, the verb is positive and singular - <strong>is</strong>. Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Darren<br/></strong><strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we heard<strong> each of the tablets </strong>and<strong> neither of them. </strong>You can use<strong> all</strong>,<strong> each</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>,<strong> either </strong>and<strong> both </strong>with <strong>of</strong> and a plural noun phrase – like <strong>the tablets</strong> – or with a pronoun – like <strong>them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. So you could say <strong>both of the tablets</strong> or <strong>both of them</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes and in this case,<strong> each of the tablets </strong>means the same as<strong> both of the tablets. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Because there are only two.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But we say <strong>each of the tablets has</strong> - that’s a singular verb - but <strong>both of the tablets have </strong>- and that's a plural verb.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's quiz time!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number one: Which is correct: a) Both of us lives in London. Or b) Both of us live in London.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is b) Both of us live in London.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And let's do number two: Which is correct? a) Neither of us likes the countryside. Or b) Neither of us doesn't like the countryside.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>This one… is a) Neither of us likes the countryside.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: Which is correct? a) Answer each questions. Or b) Answer each of the questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The answer is b). Answer each of the questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Fantastic! And that's the end of the quiz.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Quantifiers</h3>\n<p>In this session we look at the words <strong>all</strong>, <strong>each</strong>, <strong>every</strong>, <strong>both</strong>, <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>. We call them <strong>quantifiers:</strong> words that give us information about the number or amount of something. Other examples of quantifiers are some, more, less, most, enough and several. In this unit we're looking at what happens when they're followed by nouns.</p>\n<p>So first, let's examine <strong>all</strong>, <strong>each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>. If you're studying at this level then you'll know these words already. You'll know they mean the whole number of something in a group. But what are the differences?</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Answer the questions to help you work out the differences in form, meaning and use between these three words. The questions are about the topic of student accommodation.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>How did you do? We hope you got them <strong>all </strong>right! Here are the answers again, for your reference.</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>All</strong> or <strong>All the</strong> is followed by a plural or uncountable noun. <strong>Every</strong> and <strong>each</strong> are followed by a singular noun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All the students</strong> have their own rooms.</li>\n<li><strong>All the information</strong> about accommodation is on our website.</li>\n<li><strong>Every student</strong> has their own room.</li>\n<li><strong>Each student</strong> has their own room.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) </strong> <strong>Every </strong>and <strong>each </strong>can often be used in the same place, but we prefer <strong>every</strong> when we are thinking about the whole number in a group, and <strong>each</strong> when we are thinking about the members of the group as individuals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Every room</strong> has Wi-Fi. <strong>Each one</strong> has a different view.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> To emphasise the individual members of a group, use <strong>every</strong> not <strong>each</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was too late to apply for accommodation. <strong>Every room</strong> in the building is already taken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> For only two things, we can use <strong>each</strong> but not <strong>every</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The university has two student dormitories, with about 1,000 students in <strong>each building</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5) All </strong>and <strong>each</strong> but not <strong>every</strong> can be followed by <strong>of</strong> <strong>+ a plural noun or pronoun</strong><em>.</em> Notice that <strong>each of</strong> with a plural noun or pronoun is followed by a singular verb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All of the students have</strong> a phone in the room.</li>\n<li><strong>Each of them has</strong> a phone in their room.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, those are the rules for <strong>all</strong>, <strong>each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>. Look out for them in sentences you read in English - especially the difference between <strong>each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>. Next, we'll look at three more quantifiers: <strong>both</strong>, <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>More quantifiers</h3>\n<p>Now let's look at the quantifiers <strong>both</strong>, <strong>either</strong>, and <strong>neither </strong>with nouns.

Some people say that having more money makes life much easier, but others say that it can't buy you happiness. What do you think? Here's an article about the possible link between our finances and our feelings.</p>\n<p>While you're reading, decide which of these two statements is the best summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money helps us do a lot of things but it can't make our lives get better forever.</li>\n<li>Money makes our lives get better and better all the time.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>More money might not mean more happiness</h3>\n<p>Would you have the kind of reaction you can see in this picture if you were suddenly given a lot of money? It might seem greedy to want all this cash, but for some people there is nothing better than holding a <strong>wodge</strong> of <strong>notes</strong>. For them, life with money is much easier. Paying bills, eating in <strong>fancy</strong> restaurants, buying expensive <strong>luxury</strong> <strong>items</strong> – these are all things you can do if you have the money. You don't have to worry about paying the rent every month. Each time you need to replace something in your home, like a washing machine – no problem, you can pay for it. Money does make life easier in some ways.</p>\n<p>But money does not always equal happiness in every situation. There are places in the world where people don't have much money, but they are still happy. They <strong>make do</strong> with what they have and don't need money to buy expensive things. And in the past, money wasn't seen as the key to happiness. For example, parents wouldn’t buy expensive toys for their children. Instead, the children were <strong>content</strong> to play with things they found, like sticks and stones in the garden.</p>\n<p>Today in the developed world however, money might <strong>be central to</strong> our happiness. Having to pay more and more for things means we place more and more value on each coin and note in our pockets. So, the amount we earn in our jobs becomes <strong>crucial</strong> to our opinions about happiness. When we earn more, we feel happier. When countries become <strong>wealthier</strong>, there is usually improvement in education, lower <strong>child mortality</strong>, and longer <strong>life expectancy</strong>. The problem with this is that there is only so much of these things that money can buy. Things can't <strong>keep on</strong> getting better continuously.</p>\n<p>And is there a point at which money can make us <strong>decidedly</strong> unhappy? For example, high-paid jobs often come with a lot of stress. There is only so much pressure you can take before you might need to quit <strong>the rat race</strong>, however good the pay is. Not to mention that it is very difficult, maybe almost impossible, to define what happiness actually is.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you work out which was the best summary?</strong></p>\n<p>It was: Money helps us do a lot of things but it can't make our lives get better forever.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Are you happy? Time for a quiz. See if you get all the questions right.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session. Join us in Session 4 where you'll hear all about the 'stuffocation' of society. Do we have too much stuff?</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Chris Evans</strong><br>Define 'stuffocation' for us please, James.</br></p>\n<p><strong>James Wallman<br/></strong>Too much stuff. It's that feeling, Chris, when you go to your wardrobe, you open up the doors, and it's full of things that you could wear but there's nothing you actually want to put on. Or you go to a cupboard and you have to <strong>root around</strong> through loads of things that you never even use to find the one thing you actually need at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Evans<br/></strong>But we know that don't we? We do know that anyway. But you take it a lot further: you say that stuff can kill you, almost? </p>\n<p><strong>James Wallman<br/></strong>Well, the thing is, <strong>materialism</strong> and the <strong>consumer revolution</strong>… Best idea of the 20th Century: so all of the stuff we are into, buying lots of stuff gave people lots of great jobs and it <strong>transforms</strong> standards of living in the 20th Century. So it was a great idea: it solved the problem of <strong>scarcity</strong> but it's given us the problem of <strong>abundance</strong>. So much stuff that it's causing stress and anxiety and depression in record levels and that point about 'too much stuff can kill you' comes from a study from some psychologists did in Los Angeles that found, in particular for women, that for women who had too much stuff in their home and talked about too much stuff in their home, had this <strong>signature pattern</strong> of something called cortisol, which is the pattern that people have who have <strong>post-traumatic stress disorder</strong>, <strong>chronic fatigue</strong> and a higher risk of <strong>mortality</strong>. So it's not quite a kind of 'too much stuff will kill you' but there is a very close kind of <strong>correlation</strong>, too much stuff, in a headline, will lead you to an earlier <strong>grave</strong>.</p>\n<p>I think one of the interesting things about the book, and the idea of stuffocation, is just that we can all relate to it. If you mention stuffocation to people, everyone has got a story, everyone has got too much stuff. We've all got too much stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Evans<br/></strong>So what's the answer?</p>\n<p><strong>James Wallman<br/></strong>The answer is doing things. For me it's what I call 'experientialism'. Instead of thinking that were going to find happiness, identity, <strong>status</strong> and meaning in things, in stuff, I think we're going to find the best place to find happiness, identity, status and meaning is in experiences instead.<span> </span></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Can having too much harm your health?</h3>\n<p>In this session we hear an interview with a British author who believes that having too many things is very bad for us. James Wallman thinks that having so much stuff makes us <strong>suffocate</strong> - or as he calls it - 'stuffocate'.</p>\n<p>So how much is too much? And what can we do about it?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to BBC presenter Chris Evans interview James Wallman, then answer questions which will test your understanding and help you practise quantifiers. Also ask yourself: what is James's solution to stuffocation?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The solution to too much stuff?</h3>\n<p>James Wallman said that we can only feel truly happy by having experiences, not by buying more things.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>What do you think about this? Do you agree with James? Or do you think that having a lot of things is good? On the next page, it's your chance to let us know your thoughts.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Your turn</h3>\n<p>James Wallman thinks we have too much stuff in our lives, and that this can damage our health. Maybe he would prefer a home like the one in the picture below? But what about you?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you have too much stuff? Is it making you sad and upset? Or maybe shopping for new things makes you feel happy... Write down your thoughts in fewer than 100 words, and remember to use as many quantifiers as you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all</li>\n<li>some</li>\n<li>a few</li>\n<li>a bit of</li>\n<li>too much</li>\n<li>too many</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Mercedes, Spain</h3>\n<p>It is difficult to balance when it comes to acquiring objects or things that are needed.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to buy something then you have to book for future use, for example everything related to bricolage (drills, screwdrivers...).</p>\n<p>On the other hand we all have predilection for some type of object you appreciate more than another. In this case we acquired for enjoyment, such as collect something.</p>\n<p>In my case I am aware of buying a lot of books and I think some will not have time to read them.</p>\n<p>Time passes and there is much to do. </p>\n<h3>Maria</h3>\n<p>I check my wardrobe every season and set aside the clothes that are no longer in fashion, but  it's not easy to choose  and I always pick a few items that I know do not wear any more, then I buy new clothes so my wardrobe is always too full.</p>\n<p>In the kitchen I have some kitchenware that I never use; a colander, ladles, large pots but I don't like to throw them out.</p>\n<p>After reading the article by Wallman I plan to get rid of some of my stuff and give away a litte of everything superfluous.</p>\n<h3>Fábio, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I think that stuff is one problem of the global world and of our civilization/society. People feel happy when buy new objects, too many objects as possible. There is psychological comfort with this. The marketing of the stores for the products/objects increase this psychological comfort and people loves and loves to buy. I think that one solution for this kind of psychological comfort is living with what we need have and not live with we want to show. Today people lives to show instead of only to lives.</p>\n<h3>Kamilla</h3>\n<p>I think too much stuff don't make you happy.</p>\n<p>I have relatives, they have a lot of stuff at home, many beautiful and expensive things. But it's a main problem to live house for several days!!!! Because they always worry about things at home, they worry about that thiefs can steal it when home be alone. They worry about fire, floods, thiefs, e.t.c. And it's devastating!!! People might have few stuff and be happy! I think happiness in knowledges, in traveling, freedom. It's individual things if you want to be closed in your house buy much stuff and be happy! But remember you don't buy all stuff in the world! </p>\n<h3>Nguyễn</h3>\n<p>My opinion is different from Mr. Wallman's. I think that we should put stuff in the right place that we can find it easily when necessary. It not only makes our house look much better, but it also allows us to find the things we need in some situations. Having much stuff is necessary because you may need it in the future. For instance, you have many cups although you live alone. But some day, many friends of you come and you have enough cups for them to use.</p>\n<h3>Filippo</h3>\n<p>As far as I'm concerned, each person realize to have too much stuff as time goes by; in fact I've stopped to buy things less useful or in general anything I liked, in occasion of the new birth of my baby.</p>\n<p>When I was child I asked my parents to buy always new games, however sometimes they bought me, sometimes no... right now I've understood the reason.</p>\n<p>I would like to spend my time to realize too many experiences with both my baby and my wife taking too many photos just because unnecessary stuff doesn't remain impress in our life, photos does.</p>\n<p>According to James Wallman, we can only feel happy by having experiences... and photos...</p>\n<h3>Matthieu</h3>\n<p>It is obvious there is to many things in my house. Moreover, since I am student in Paris, all the members of my family put some things they don't need in my room, so it is now a merry mess, where my huge collection of books and comics meets old toys of my sister and my mother's twenty-years-old school books.</p>\n<p>Oddly, I don't feel any lose of breathe surrounded by all this unnecessary furniture and I love both my wood cat and my cactus which are as useless as funny.</p>\n<p>I will be sad when I will soon have to leave this capernaum to my empty student room...</p>\n<h3>Naoki</h3>\n<p>Immediately, so many things filled up my new house.</p>\n<p>First, my room had only few furnitures and there was a large empty space. That made me feel uncomfortable and stressed so I wanted to buy things fill my room and my mind. However, as the room got narrower, I felt sick and suffocated.</p>\n<p>I think neither having too many things nor having very few things are good for us, but too much stuff is worse than the latter one as it makes me much more stressful.</p>\n<p>To grab happiness, we should know how much stuff comforts us the most.</p>\n<h3>Regina, Brasil</h3>\n<p>I don't know when I started to mind about the quantities of stuff there were in the world. I started by my room fills of many things, sometimes I didn't know what I had and what I should be inneed, how I could kept so much things? I tryed to understand, loooking outside, talking with my friends and relatives when I realized that we were almost the same, buying, keeping without necessity.</p>\n<p>In my particular case I have been changing, I can't continuous to fill the world with so much stuff. what in the future it will be? We need to think about the people that come after us living with all this stuff. The Planet should be better for the news generations. Now, before going shopping I ask to myself am I inneed to buy something? This way of thinking brought to me more conciens that we need few things and it isn't necessary too much for being happy.</p>\n<h3>Rita</h3>\n<p>I don't have too many things at home. Actually, I use everything except a few wine cups and some spare sheets and blankets for guests. All my pots and pans are used almost every week.</p>\n<p>Some summer T-shirts are not so often used, it depends on my epilation frequency. (lol)</p>\n<p>Maybe I have too many cleansing products because I usually get them through the well-known offer: \"Buy 3 pay 2\".</p>\n<p>The fact that I have recently divorced and bought a new flat is very likely the reason why I don't have too much stuff at home.</p>\n<p>There is a feeling of scarcely here, but not material scarcely. It is a problem of loneliness and a lack of affection.</p>\n<h3>Hasan</h3>\n<p>Alright, first of all, I am too much grateful to you, because you give us such an opportunity. I have lived in Turkey until couple months ago. I absolutely can say that there are too much furniture, too much stuff in Turkish houses. Actually all of them reflect of a bit of our culture.</p>\n<p>I had a bit of mentioned headache, chronic fatigue until couple months ago. Now I’m living in Sweden. In here everything is more simple and pure. I gathered all of my unnecessary stuff and I threw all of them to garbage. What did I throw to garbage? First, I had too many video games, too much small clothes. And a few unnecessary goods.</p>\n<p>Sure, I like to shopping. It makes me happy, too much happy. But I'm pay attention to buy significant and necessary stuff.</p>\n<h3>Silvia, Italy</h3>\n<p>Some months ago I moved to a new house, so I had to pack all my stuff up. I had never realized before how many things I had: wardrobes, closets, the cellar and the attic full of old stuff or things I used maybe once or twice! It took ages to put everything in the boxes... Afterwards I spent few weeks on my granma's house. I brought with me only few indispensable objects and some clothes but I didn't need anything more. So I realized I had too much stuff in my new house and then I decided to throw, sell or give away lots of things. I felt lighter.</p>\n<h3>Cathrine, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>Well, what can I say about the stuff? It makes me depressed. I fill uncomfortable if there is too much stuff in my apartment.<br> <br/> I try to throw out all the unnecessary things as soon as I understand that I don't need them anymore. Also I have a rule. If I buy something new, I must get rid of something old. As well, I often do revision of closets, balconies and pantries to identify and throw out all the stuff. I like that picture on your site. Maybe it's too much, but there is some point in it.</br></p>\n<p>I think that the stuff can't make us happy. We need love, emotions, feelings, new experiences. Our life must be interesting; hardly a new vase or a carpet can replace the journey to the sea or play with children or chat with friends...</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos </h3>\n<p>Well, let me see... I'm in the attic and I am crazy. No that's other tail. Well, I turn my head around and I see two computers, old computers, toys, books, films, portraits. I could say too much stuff I would talk to my wife to select many of these things and throw them away, you know we have too much stuff but it isn't easy to say bye bye to all them. I don't know why but I have to take advice with her before move from one shelf to other. And if I want to rid an old magazine is impossible. I only get it if she doesn't know I'm going to do it. So if she is abroad and I am at home I can throw the parrot support away. I understand she wants to keep the dresses of when our daughter was a new born but we have the dresses of her cousins I don't why. There are too many things that hinder my sight and I would like to see books only books on the shelves.</p>\n<h3>Nuray</h3>\n<p>My room is very simply designed. Because I think when you raise your head, you shouldn't distract. When I read a book my only want is see the sky or trees not some kind of distracting stuff. So my opinion is having too much stuff is not a good for us. In the other hand, sometimes we feel so angry, lonely, depressed. And we want just buy something. Maybe it is a defence mechanism. We just want to redirect our feelings to something new. It is sometimes can be life saving.</p>\n<p>Ultimately all of the things are in our control :)</p>\n<h3>Tahnee, Brazil</h3>\n<p>When I was a child and lived with all my family, my two brothers and I shared a bedroom and we had so many things there, until my brother went to live alone. We felt happy to have more space to organize our furniture and buy more... then some few years after my sister went to live abroad and all of that things still in the bedroom. I thought about this and gave most of the clothes, accessories, toys for a charity institute, because a bit of these objects still making sense for me, because they bring me good memories from our childhood. So it is a good way to not have to much stuff: keep with you only something that make sense, other way, this things will make other people happy.</p>\n<h3>Alex, Russia</h3>\n<p>Every time I used t complain that there is not enough time to do sports and spend time with my family. Until, I realized that a lot of my personal time goes for the stuff I owned and buy. We all trying to get a good deal spending to much time searching for a sale, choosing the best item in the store, leaning all about new TV or a new model of phone. The worst come that we also spend a vast of our time for maintaining and keeping save the items which we owned. It a non stop. It's like a protein wheel they always create something new and you again have to get the best deal. It never stops.</p>\n<p>A fake life values drives our life, it keeps us busy day to day until we get old and understand that the beauty of life is in the experience. The life gives us a chance experience much more interesting things from traveling to love.</p>\n<p>I have changed my style of life, stop buying new trades and all the fashion items and keep only most important stuff for myself.</p>\n<p>I spend more time leaning, traveling and spending with people who I love.</p>\n<h3>Pamela, Argentina</h3>\n<p>I love travel, for the last five years I lived in four different cities, sharing apartment with others, but just renting a room. Because that, I decided to have the less stuff possible, It's easier to move and start again in a new home. I didn't need to have big stuff, neither furniture nor washing machine, in every apartment the rent of a room included this kind of things.</p>\n<p>In the last year I live as a couple and I have a formal job. Since then, I feel I started to accumulate more stuff, buying furniture and electronics. I believe that is the normal way when you start an adult life. However, my partner and I, both like to have new experiences, we still travel a lot, we prefer to use the money in this, instead buying things.</p>\n<h3>Adauto, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Buying a lot of unnecessary things can bring us a piece of happiness, but only for a little while. This habit is more common than we imagine, I think every people use to go shopping to buy some stuff which is really necessary,but along the way they find out goods with huge discounts and  the end of this story everybody knows, I mean more things which will hardly be used and in a little while will become a lot of garbage.</p>\n<h3>Patricio, Argentina</h3>\n<p>I live in an apartment and with minimum things that we bought with my girlfriend we are happy... Obviously you need to gain money to buy different things but the point is not getting crazy to obtain more and more...</p>\n<p>We like to travel and live many experiences in different places... We always are open to ask for a piece of advice in order to learn about the other...</p>\n<p>We hope to get to know many places in the future and get happiness in each of them!</p>\n<h3>Vasyl, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>My own home contains plenty of things. Moreover, there are too many things in my garage and there is too much stuff in my house in the country. And though every time I feel some irritation about something useless, however there is a bit of confidence and even hundreds of times there were no doubts that its time will come. For instance throughout past few years, building sauna in the country, I have been using too much so called garbage instead of buying all those construction materials. One more example: either travelling by car or having any trouble with electricity I take an old foam box instead of fridge and I hurry to assure you it was forgotten for many years before to receive its second chance. </p>\n<h3>Rodrigo, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Most of people enjoy shopping because it makes them feel better at that moment. I believe it's a temporary sensation and won't help us feel truly happy for a long time. Buying things is good, however I invite you to buy good \"memories\" or \"experiences\" as James Wallman suggested us in his book. Is it possible?</p>\n<p>But it's possible to build good memories and they will last forever. How? Traveling, meeting new things, cultures, people and so on. Leave your routine and live. There is a whole world outside waiting for you. It will be a journey of good experiences to remember during all your life and I'm sure every time you remember how good your experiences were, you'll feel better.</p>\n<h3>Cheniappan, India</h3>\n<p>I don't have too much stuff in my house because I don't have that much of money to buy. Even though I don't have money I felt happy but in recent times something (like cinema, TV, advertisements, etc.) push me to earn more money to buy expensive things. This type of articles makes me understand the reality and prevent me from doing something wrong. If I think like this I prefer ancient times where we had no money.</p>\n<h3>Richard, France</h3>\n<p>I think that having too much stuff is the sign of a discomfort. We don't need having many things to be happy. But in this consumer society, children have been often growing in the abundance. It's more difficult for them to find the happiness.</p>\n<h3>Diego, Italy</h3>\n<p>I'm an Italian student and I think that I haven't got too much stuff, but if I do a comparison with all the coetaneous of poor countries, I'm clearly 'stuffocate' (cit. James Wallman).</p>\n<p>With the Economic welfare and technology development of these last years, we could buy too many things that make our house much more comfortable and smart, but this isn't the happiness.</p>\n<p>Also shopping is the effect of a quick fashion development that make the people instantly very happy because it gets them away from the everyday work or life, but when you return at home this 'shopping wellness' sensation is already gone.</p>\n<h3>Irina, Russia</h3>\n<p>I really don't like having much stuff. There are only useful and necessary things in my home. All of them make my life easier and more comfortable. When I buy something new I give the old things to someone or to the charity organizations or if the thing is broken I throw it in the trash. Having too much stuff makes me a bit anxious.  It is much easier to breathe when there is a lot of free space around you. I think we don't need too many material things to be happy.</p>\n<h3>Beatriz</h3>\n<p>Yes, I have too much stuff in my closet and too many new suits for my job. Sometimes I can not find the blouse or the skirt of my uniform because all is in a mess, however  I think, I have some old clothes because they are too good to be out, and a lot of them are new so... I suppose, a bit of order it's needed here, only!</p>\n<h3>Emmanuel</h3>\n<p>This interview amazed me that there is a correlation between desire and health. At first, I thought \"having too much stuff\" was not my problem because I don't have enough money to buy things that I want and also I feel like I need to save money for my future. But, I do have desire to be rich and I will do whatever it takes to reach my goal. Having too much money might apply to correlation of desire and health. It's hard to picture myself that I would most likely to hurt myself mentally, if I pursue making more and more money.</p>\n<h3>Jurate, Lithuania</h3>\n<p>When I have someone visiting me at home I often get asked same questions: Haven't you got any chairs? Where's your table? My mom especially is disatisfied with me and points out now and again that neither a piece of nice new furniture nor a carpet would do any wrong to my place. But I still don't buy either of those. I like having few possessions because it helps me feel free. I prefer my place clean and simple to a plush one, I prefer space to things. In fact, I think I would feel bad with too many things. All there is in my room is an old wardrobe with a sofa that I got from my grandparents when they were refurnishing their home, a big gym mat and a laptop. To own less allows to see better what is going on beyond one's limited existence.</p>\n<h3>Emiliano, Italy</h3>\n<p>Too much stuff, right, true: in my case that mean dozens of books and some clothes wich will become fast older.<br/>But all our economy is based on production of things that we really donot need. If we stop to buy things, the shops will immediatly stop to sell thing, and of course the firm level would be bloked. Money in exchange of things, or better, at deeper level: all the things are producted for making money. With the 'financialization' we have tried to jump the step of the commodity making money from money... but it didn't work: money could be built from thin air, but this can create a disaster as we've seen, because they can desapperar in onvernight creating the worlwide panic.<br/>Every one must try to understand a bit of economy, because we must change our way of life. Mybe each and every one have to do a small private revolution.</p>\n<h3>Lisa, Netherlands</h3>\n<p>I have seriously too much stuff. I buy too many things I think. When I'm cleaning up my room, I have really no idea where I have to put all my stuff. I don't need so much stuff. I have a lot of make-up, clothes and shoes. Why? Because I like it. I like stuff. I like to go shopping with my father. I like to watch Vampire Diaries.</p>\n<h3>Nicholas, Netherlands</h3>\n<p>I think that people of now a days have too much stuff but we love buying new and more things. When we get new things we use it for a while but later on we don't use all the old stuff. I think that we must buy necessary things that we use years and years later. We don't always love too much stuff. It can be stressful. If you don't use stuff you can give it away to people who need it and still use it.</p>\n<h3>Hugo, Netherlands</h3>\n<p>I think I have a lot of stuff. I have too much clothing and too many books. But it's not making me sad because I love having stuff. Shopping sometimes makes me feel happy but sometimes it makes me feel sad. I think too much stuff is not good for people. Sometimes stuff makes people sad. And also buying stuff makes some people sad. If I buy things I feel happy. I don't know why but it gives me a good feeling.</p>\n<h3>Agata, Italy</h3>\n<p>When I lived in Italy, I earned a lot of money and with my family we bought a lot of things, a bigger house, a more powerful car, and many many stuff and clothes.<br/>When my daughter went away to study abroad my house looked empty and too big for me and my husband.<br/>I lost my job so I thought I could live with 100 of things and have new experiences.<br/>Now with my husband we have only 200 things and we are probably happier than before.<br/>All energies are to improve english language and have more experience.<br/>Some days I remember my previous life and a few tears go down but only for a few minutes.<br/>A bit of English humor make me happy again if I think that too much stress in having too many things.</p>\n<h3>Catherine, France</h3>\n<p>I can say that I have too much stuff at home and sometimes it makes me anxious, especially when I think about moving. Shopping new things is not really the problem but I am fifty seven and, in the long run, I've been keeping all my books , my children toys and a few little and less little presents.,<br/>Sometimes I give a bit of stuff, clothes and books and I throw out old newspapers, half broken kitchen equipment and I sort out a few papers. It's a little victory!<br/>But it's a fight with my husband who wants to keep everything!</p>\n<h3>Cinzia, Italy</h3>\n<p>I do agree with James Wallman. We have too many things we do not really need. However, in the past I used to buy stuff when I was stressed for my job or when I felt depressed.Today, I actually tend to buy too much food for my family even if it is not necessary because I'm afraid to have an empty fridge. Luckily, it is not a compulsory attitude for me but just something I'm aware of and I trying to control.<br/>I love reading a lot and if I could I will spend much money buying books but unfortunatly it is not always possible and therefore I borrow some from the local library.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I must say that money can't make you happy but it helps to have a better life.</p>\n<h3>Maury, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I agree with James Wallman when he says that having too much stuff in our lives can damage our health. When also he says that we buy a lot of things, but we never want to try on or we have used them before. I have seen too many people that want to be happy and they think that the happiness is in material things. But the same people forget that the happiness is in untouchable things like true experiences. I can exemplify: people can make a trip with their family or with their friends or even alone. Making a trip is a wonderful experience. In my opinion we have to buy useful things and we have to ask to ourselves before we buy them if, do we really need to buy all the these things?</p>\n<h3>Marie, Quebec</h3>\n<p>I completely agree with Mr Wallman. In French we have a saying : Owning nothing is Freedom. Believe me. I have experienced it, it’s true !<br/>At home in Quebec, I have too much stuff to take care. Some days, I can’t enjoy life as I should. I have to say a few « no » to many invitations.<br/>On other hand,I have a great opportunity to live in Hawaii for 6 months a year. Life is much lay back. I have a small studio and a small piece of luggage, that’s all. Life with friends is wonderful.<br/>All my day isn’t long enough to enjoy life away far from stuffocation. Too much stuff makes your life out of the essential pathway.</p>\n<h3>Alina, Romania</h3>\n<p>I had been living in communism when we hadn't found too much stuff as we are finding now. The stores' shelves had had very few products that quickly disappeared.</p>\n<p>But nowadays, Romanians are trying to overcome those bad memories and they have been buying almost everything, especially all the products that have some discount.</p>\n<p>Personally, I realised, I have had too much stuff on my wardrobe. Every time when I clean it, it is almost impossible not to find some out fashion clothes or clothes that sizes are inappropriate. Every time when I finds clothes that don't fit me, I give it to people who don't have.</p>\n<p>Life is about to gain more experiences than account money in our bank account. When we die, what we have is our life experience: how many books did you read, or how many places did you visit?</p>\n<p>We don't take any things with us, when we past away. Than why we don't focus much more on our life experiences not by having more things?</p>\n<h3>José Luis, Spain</h3>\n<p>I agree James Wallman. All of us have too many things. He is right because in develop countries we have lots of things at home: devices, furnitures, useless things, and meanly clothes. Our wardroves are plenty of clothes and many different stuff.</p>\n<p>I think that way is a little bit sad. A wrong way. I’m sure we can better enjoy life without the most of that stuff. We are really materialistic. We could share our wages with poor people and with fewer things, will would be happier.</p>\n<p>And finally, go shopping is not my favourite hobby.</p>\n<h3>Irene, Russia</h3>\n<p>Hello! As many women I like buying new stuff. Moreover I buy things I really don't need sometimes. Then all that clothes and items take too much place in my wardrobe but I use them seldom so it makes me feel depressed. That’s why I set a rule for myself. Every weekend I open my wardrobe and if I recognize that I haven’t been using some things for a long time I throw them out immediately. So I get enough space for something new or I just make some shelfs empty. I agree with James Wallman. Instead of buying new stuff we should spend more money on travelling for example. Because \"no matter how old your shoes if you walk in them in Paris\".</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>I think we've got too many things because we trick ourselves into believing that happiness is something we can buy through money, but such happiness lasts a very short period of time.</p>\n<p>As far as I'm concerned, money is important to the extent that it allows me to eat every day and have a place to sleep at night. I am really happy only when people make me feel esteemed, appreciated and helpful for all I do every day, but unfortunately it's not something we can always manage to get. Trying to buy too many things is also a way of gratifying ourselves every time we feel too much depressed.</p>\n<h3>Alessandra, Italy</h3>\n<p>I do agree with James Wallman, because I really have too many things in my home and above all in my wardrobe. Every morning I can’t decide which shirt or which trousers wear, however I feel very happy when I go shopping. It sounds incredible! I also have too much stuff around. It is because my friends give me some useless things for Christmas or for my birthday. At the end my partner and me have decided we give us a trip or a gig for Christmas or for birthday.</p>\n<h3>Erika</h3>\n<p>I used to live in a big apartment, I had too much stuff and not idea about that, I wasn't aware of how many things I had accumulated over the years, but I found out about it when I was about to move to a smaller apartment, I had too many boxes and much all my stuff couldn't fit in those boxes so I had to donate many things, especially stuff that I hardly used, which was a good thing, I could get rid of the things and also help people who need them.</p>\n<p>A few things remain in my new apartment, most of them are really necessary and it feels good to have a place with a bit of things.</p>\n<p>As the previous article argued, experiences counts more than materialism.<br/>There's a saying that says: Less is more and I couldn't agree more.</p>\n<h3>Mauro, Italy</h3>\n<p>Too much stuff im my house? Certainly! I've been collecting too many things during my travels all over the world. Some of them remind me unforgettable adventures, I'll keep them forever. Some people gave me a few of the others to remind their country, no way, I cant get rid of them! I think that all the things that are in my house have a reason to remain where I put them anyway. Probably the only useless thing standing now in my house is myself, so I'll go away to make another trip around the world.</p>\n<h3>Azizakif, Turkey</h3>\n<p>Materialism means my soul suffocates in things. Things designed by artists or manufacturer simulate all real stuff around us. It is impossible for me to relieve when l look at a fake of genuine. Therefore l would prefer a simple designed room or space.</p>\n<p>Simple designed space or house never has too much stuff. It provides me to think and move around freely. If my house or room had too many things, all my brain would be captured by things which are designed by other souls.</p>\n<p>Above all don't interpret that bed is enough for living. I am not a soulist. A few special items can be in my room. But correlation between me and a bit of stuff is crucial to stimulate my soul. For example my son's two small cars and his photograph make me feel better. I remember our experiences with him thanks to them. The experiences are vital at that point time and let off our soul from things.</p>\n<h3>Viridiana</h3>\n<p>I agree with the writer, stuffocation is bad for our health and nowadays it's a real problema, besides all the health problems mentioned in the texts it affects our energy, if we open our warddrobes and everything is in order and clean we feel good but if it's a mess, we have a lack of energy and immediately we start feeling bad. Peace also gives us health =)</p>\n<h3>Anazilda, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I do agree we have too much stuff and it is stealing our happiness. No one can fly with so much baggage.<br/>I try to live with simplicity. I only buy a piece of clothing if some other is not in good conditions any more, and I try to find someone who can reuse or recycle it. And if some friend give me one as a gift, I chose another do send do charity institutions.</p>\n<p>I do the same with furniture and other things. I have no car, no TV and just a simple tablet, not very expensive.</p>\n<p>But I cannot resist to buy books. I always buy much more books than I can read. I have no more space avaiable at home. I know I should donate my books to a public library, and borrow them when I have enough time to read, but I can't! Pehaps I need the help of the Annonymous Book Buyers :)</p>\n<h3>Trinh</h3>\n<p>A buffet is a typical example of the \"stuffocation\". You get in a fancy restaurant where a buffet is waiting for you. Too much food of the buffet makes you distracted and you usually could not manage to choose the right courses to make a good balance meal. Instead, you have a tendency to taste all of them. \"I do not know why I usually eat more at a buffet – it is not hunger, it is just greed\", said many people and most of them confess that they feel uncomfortable several days afterward, however delicious the food is.</p>\n<h3>Sonia, Poland</h3>\n<p>I love shopping and I've got quite much stuff especially in my wardrobe. Although it buying new things makes me happy sometimes I think that's shouldn't be the most important thing in our lives. Really sad event in my life had made that I have changed my point of view. Now I would like to travel, meet new people from all over the world and collect memories in my life - not just more and more things. Of course, money and some stuff help us live decently but I find that people who just work hard in order to buy new, better car, expensive clothes and the best stuff are not really happy. I want you all to remember that in our lives is just one and sure thing that no one can take away from us - our memories and experience.</p>\n<h3>Kate</h3>\n<p>Yes, I have too much stuff, especially in my wardrobe. When I make an order with my clothes a few of them I leave because I think that I put it on one more time, but in just a bit of them it’s true. Having a lot of cloths doesn't make me happy. Like each women often I have a problem what I wear. I look for a cloth in my wardrobe and I don't found anything despite too many things. But I love buy a lot of things to my house it's the best think to get the better humor.</p>\n<h3>Angel, Spain</h3>\n<p>A lot of time ago, when I began to work and I earned my firsts salaries, I remember that I wanted to buy a lot of things. In few months I had my home full of stuff. This was for a while. After a few years, I realized that too much stuff in your life, like the earlier text claim, makes the life more complex.<br/>Now, I try having few things. I say that everything you need must fit into a rucksack. The more important things in the life don't take up physical space, but space in your mind and in your hearth.</p>\n<h3>Pia, Germany</h3>\n<p>I really think I've too much stuff. I've collected many things over years and now I'm not able to give them away. It's not because of memories, it's because I don't know where to start. All these things overwhelm me. I think it would be a good feeling to donate most of the things and to reduce my property. In my opinion we'll be satisfied, if we spent more time with our families and friends, instead of consuming.</p>\n<h3>Khalid, Yemen</h3>\n<p>I love easy life. Having a lot of things could make me upset, so before I decide getting anything I think about its importance for my life. I think all essential needs are fewer than luxuries. When people have too many things, they lose how enjoy them. I have some clothes, so I can choose easily, I have not too much furniture in my house, because I feel happy when live in wide place, even when I travel I take a few things.</p>\n<h3>Claudia, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I'm a Brazilian student. I don't have a lot of things, and I try to have less and less things, 'cause I do agree with James Wallman; people have too much stuff and try to find hapiness on it, and not in the experiences we have in our lives.<br/>Putting hapiness on stuff could make people ill, because in te end they realize that money and stuff ins't everthing, and that's the illness.<br/>We have to learn to live with a few things, stop to go shopping just because we're upset with something, or 'cause we're stressed out. Hapiness is inside of you and me, our mission is findind it in each other.</p>\n<h3>Dan Sun, China</h3>\n<p><strong>All </strong>female friends of mind enjoy shopping. <strong>Some</strong> of them keep saying that there is always one dress missing in their closets, even though they have <strong>too many</strong> clothes hanging in there, it’s still difficult to pick up one to put on. From my point of view, shopping is a good way to help me relax as well as the way to spend <strong>a bit of</strong> time with my friend every week while I am doing that.  We try on new clothes and give advice to each other, sometimes we don’t buy it if it costs <strong>too much</strong>. I think everything should be in a certain balance, going shopping <strong>a few</strong> times every month is reasonable, just don’t overdo it.</p>\n<h3>Nuria, Barcelona</h3>\n<p>Yes, I have too much stuff in my house. I like buying a lot of thinks by internet because the price is good. But now I'm trying to buy only some things that I need.</p>\n<p>Once or twice a year I organize my wardrobe, my library and I give my old things to someone or a charity organization. When I finish that I feel better.</p>\n<h3>Pavlo, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I have lots of stuff at my home but it doesn’t make me uncomfortable. I believe that if you keep all your things in right places it will never disturb you. In addition to this you will always have access to everything you need.</p>\n<p>However you have to spend a bit of your free time to clean up. Of course you won’t like it but it’s better than spending much more time to choose what to keep and what to throw out.</p>\n<p>All in all I think that the best way to deal with useless stuff is to think twice before buying something new to your house.</p>\n<h3>Tania, Italy</h3>\n<p>I have too much stuff in my home! I'd like to live in empty spaces but the reality is a little bit different: all my rooms are full of things and some objects I have are really unuseful!  I have too many shoes, too much baggage, many books, and even too much forniture. I'm happy to have many books but sometimes I think I've lost a lot of time and too much money to buy all this stuff I don't really need. And so I would like to get free from this stuff in few minutes, using a little bit of magic.</p>\n<h3>Erdem Erbey, Turkey</h3>\n<p>I think this subject is closing releated with minimalism. Minimalism is a movement of idea that influence various field like art or music claim be simplicity. for consumption I read an interetsting minimalist idea that suggest have limited good or things. For example you should to decide haw many shirts would you keep in your gardrobe. it depends on you, it could be 5 or 10. And when you determine the number of shirts that you wear in a year you should follow this rule. so if you want to or intend to buy a new shirts you can't only consider having enough money you olso think about which shirts would you throw out in your gardorbe instead of this? This solution help me very much and when we take together its with this novel we could say that limit our consumption is important for our happiness not only economic conditions.</p>\n<h3>Irene, Spain</h3>\n<p>I think I’m actually stuffocating. Every day I realize more and more the problem that is causing me owing too much stuff and particularly all the things I have at home. It makes me angry, nervous and upset each time I’m trying to decide what to wear and I have so many T-shirt that I haven’t   even wear yet, or when looking in my drawer for something I need urgently but I can’t find it because it’s full up with other useless objects or rooting around through all the bottles of spices we have, just to decide which one I need. For that reason I’m gonna try to concentrate in things that really make me happy, like traveling, learning new facts and living exiting experiences instead of worrying about the things I have and the ones I don’t have already in my closet.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Salvador López, Panamá</h3>\n<p>So, I don´t like to have too much stuff in my apartment, i love open spaces, that´s makes me feel free and confortable.  Some times I get a few antiques objetcs to ornament my living room, some things like cameras, music instruments and old toys.  In Panama, our weather is tropical and humidity, that´s just because, I need to have free space to breath phisycall and mentality.</p>\n<h3>Svetlana</h3>\n<p>I like comfort, and I hate lacking of something I need at the moment. I am not a rich person and I don't have luxury things. But I love my big bed and my lovely deep armchair that I like sitting in the evening and watching an expensive TV with high-quality picture. Why should these all things make me less happy? Vice versa, I am glad that my wardrobe is ready for every event in my life: work, a meeting, a date, a party, a barbeque with friends. Some time I notice that I have too much clothes, then I look over my dresses and give some of them to over people.</p>\n<h3>Ammår</h3>\n<p>Before a few months ago , I lived in suffocation hell since i had started my study in college of architecture , Loads of carton foam paper ... etc , on bed on my office  down top bottom .... anywhere , cleaning the room be very deficullt work ,, finally my room was neglected because i dont have a time to clean it ... nowdays im in holiday month im work every day to room still clean and fresh ..  </p>\n<p>im hopeful :) </p>\n<h3>Monize</h3>\n<p>Nowadays people live in an individualistic way. The capitalist world dominates the global culture. Every day, people are bombarded with many advertisements about products that claim are essential to living well. This ultimately results in an exaggerated increase in consumerism and accumulation of things, which often become unnecessary and futile. But the essential question is: Does money buy happiness? The truth is that money helps to bring comfort, whose sense may seem happiness, but it is not. It is not uncommon to realize a sense of loneliness in the midst of so many people, those who have a large amount of money. The sincere and unpretentious friendship does not arise from greed and falsehood. Each sincere friendship brings happiness, fullness and satisfaction. Likewise is in relation to the care of close relationships, every smile of those who like, every thank you for a good deed. Anyway, money helps to survive in a globalized world, but do not buy the full happiness, just adds to the feeling of all illusion to think that one is happy.</p>\n<h3>Javier, Bilbao</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve got a problem because of all the stuff I’ve got at home. I live in a small flat where there is not enough place for so many things. Not all of them are useful, a few of them are needed things like my motorbike clothing but on the other hand I retain too many useless things like old student´s books from my childhood or some old-fashioned furniture that I will never use again.</p>\n<p>So my conclusion is clear, It´s better to make do with not too many things rather than owning too much staff and no place to keep it.</p>\n<h3>Viviana, Italy</h3>\n<p>That's true. We live overwhelmed by too much stuff, and I don't really know how much useful they are. I realize this thing everytime I prepare my camping backpack before to leave for 10 days into the woods. I can put in there just a few things, but they are enough for those days. There's no need to overdo in our lives. The objects do not make us happy, do not complete us and do not change our lives. We can learn all these things just living day by day, meeting people and making experiences, just like James Wallman says.</p>\n<h3>Ibrahim</h3>\n<p>What I think about stuff?</p>\n<p>    In my opinion that most people buy alot of things which is not mandatory in their life. They spend too much money to fill their homes in unuseful furniture.</p>\n<p>    In my country people always buy what they don't use, unfortunately this is reflect to our culture.</p>\n<p>    I think neither scarcity nor abundance are good, people should buy what they need necessary, moreover they should kick off old stuff.</p>\n<p>    For me I like shopping, so actually I have too much thing I have to throw it out.</p>\n<h3>Antonio, Spain</h3>\n<p>I don’t think I have too much stuff in my home.</p>\n<p>Right now, I’ve been living with my girlfriend. We are tidy and we haven't got too many objects in our house.</p>\n<p>In my case, I have too much clothes, even more than my partner. But, twice a year, I donate the clothes that I didn't use. Nowadays, I also buy new clothes, normally in winter and summer sales discounts.</p>\n<p>I think is important to be tidy and to know how many things you need in your life to be happy. You will not be happier by having too much stuff.</p>\n<h3>Akin</h3>\n<p>Yes I have too much stuff.Actually we have,because of I've maried and I've got a child who is 15 years old girl.I think in this 20th centry,every women and too mant men are addicted shopping. This kind of people ,without thinking wheter they need to have things,just do shopping to be happy.İndeed it's like to use alcohol or drugs and to smoke.They just want to buy something,it's not important what it is that they need it.So,they come back their home and put all of things which bought to wordrobe or cupboard or somewhere sort of that,next day they are unhappy again İf they won't go shopping.</p>\n<p>                My wife is a prototipe of this kind of person,I think mt daughter will be in the close future.I don't able to do to change all of this.</p>\n<h3>Ília</h3>\n<p>There was a time I spent a lot of money and time buying too much stuff especially when I had a new home.<br/> But quickly I realized that as more full of stuff I had at home and wardrobe more dificult cleaning and organizing was.<br/> So I started doing the opposite, trying to keep just the necessary stuff. <br/> Now I always do that balance keeping the most necessary and buying less that it is possible and tranfering money spent in thing to experiences with family and friends or traveling looking for more fullfilment.<br/> But even with experinces we have to take it with balance and intelligence not running to live everything as to do with stuff.<br/> On that case we can create a similar word to stuffocating like \"expfocating\".</p>\n<h3>Pawan, Nepal</h3>\n<p>Off and on, I go shopping - haggle at times - and buy some superfluous stuff. Often I feel my predilection for gadgets has cost me much but I do not resent it.<br/> <br/> I rather understand 'Stuffocation' is the conflict between desire and need, where desire surmounts the need. So, in my opinion, people in trying to keep up cachet in society, buy too many ostentatious stuff that has very little usage - giving room for 'sttuffocation'.</p>\n<h3>Francesco</h3>\n<p>James Wallman ideas are very interesting but he only shows a partial view.<br/> As in other situation the truth lies in the center. too much stuff smothers probably and an empty house is a very desolation set-up. In my opinion the stuff value  changes in order to our link with things. Last Sunday I have met an homeless with a shopping cart extremely full of things and in the afternoon I have visited some rich friends; they lived in a minimal style house with  a bit of stuff on the carpet and only with some furniture. Who has more things? Who is more fortunate? I don’t Know.</p>\n<h3>Guille</h3>\n<p>Sometimes we lose something that we had been keeping because it was very important and we realize that it wasn’t important at all; we aren’t sad without it. I really have liked the final conclusion, we have to try to change our finding of happiness in having more things to live more a better experiences. Of course is really difficult in today’s world, full of marketing campaigns which associated his products with happiness, respect and admiration. We will have to try our best, it will be a hard fight against the materialism.</p>\n<h3>Arielle</h3>\n<p>I am not well-paid but my work stresses me so much. I can’t even plan to do something else in a day without something at work coming on to avoid it. I have no time for me, all goes to my work. I have no time to see what happens in everyday life like buying new clothes or just chilling out with friends.</p>\n<p>In fact, my job manages my time schedule and the matter is not that I do not have enough money to really live; the matter is that I have not enough time to enjoy life. I can’t bear this situation but changing it means seeking a new job with different conditions. Is it a solution?</p>\n<p>Actually, I think I just have to master my life not letting my job does it in my place in order to have some free time and days-off to appreciate moments in life.</p>\n<h3>Alfonso, Spain</h3>\n<p>Reading Wallman's article makes me think of this subject. All of us are living in a very material world, we are always buying stuff we do not need. I know that sometimes, when we are sad, we need to buy something that makes us happy for a while, but we should buy only what we need.</p>\n<p>      We live in a technological world, everyday there is a new mobile phone, more sophisticated than the previous one, or a new tablet, a new car, a new television, a new bike, and when we see them, the first thing we think is: \"I want it!\"</p>\n<p>      But we have to reflect on buying only necessary stuff. When we want to get something, that thing is fantastic, marvellous, but when we get it, it is not as beautiful as before, because desire is too much strong.</p>\n<p>      I agree with Wallman, experiences are very good to be happy, stay with people you love, read a book, go to a concert, travel, etc.</p>\n<p>     Stuff makes us slaves.</p>\n<h3>Vitaliy Debre, Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>in general, I do not have a lot of stuff, because my apartment is not quite big enough and there is no place for storing too many things. Nevertheless, I still have had a problem with things which I do not use but I keep it at home and do not throw it away. I have such a kind of attachment and feel some old connection with them. </p>\n<p>Anyway, time to time I do a big revision of things and try to get rid of stuff as much as I can which I do not use a long time or I do not like.</p>\n<p>Also, I try to keep order in the rooms and hide some stuff to the cupboard and boxes of different size. I believe if it is the order in the space around me it will be the order in my head :).</p>\n<p>I like to live in a clean place, but not as on your picture. I think it is a little bit too clean for me, as in the hospital. :)</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session.

Today we’re talking about short spoken forms. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's words like <strong>gonna</strong>, <strong>wanna</strong> and <strong>gotta</strong> that we use a lot in spoken English. Let’s start by listening to Jason and Yuki talking about their plans for the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And here’s a question: Who’s Yuki meeting on Saturday night? Have a listen.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong><strong>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Yuki<br/></span></strong><span>I<strong> dunno. </strong>I’m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Jason<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Yuki<br/></span></strong><span>No, thanks. I’ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Jason<br/></span></strong><span>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well that was Jason and Yuki. We asked you: Who’s Yuki meeting on Saturday night?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine    <br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: she’s probably going to meet Lucy.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>That’s right. But instead of saying <strong>going to</strong>, Yuki said <strong>gonna</strong>. <strong>She’s probably gonna meet Lucy</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and that’s what we’re looking at in this programme. English speakers often say the words<strong> going to </strong>very fast – and it sounds like<strong> gonna. </strong>They usually do this in informal situations when they’re talking to friends.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So does that mean that you shouldn’t say <strong>gonna</strong> when you need to speak carefully and politely, like in a job interview?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, not necessarily. If <strong>gonna</strong> comes out naturally, it’s probably ok. But a job interview is formal, so it’s probably a bit more polite to say <strong>going to</strong>. And you don’t usually use <strong>gonna</strong> in writing, unless you’re actually writing down a dialogue.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In fact some people never use it, even informally. Although it’s probably more common in American English.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And one other thing about <strong>gonna</strong> is that we only use it to replace <strong>going to</strong> when it’s followed by a verb.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. If you say: <strong>I’m going to Paris</strong>, you can’t use <strong>gonna</strong> to say: I’m <strong>gonna</strong> Paris. You’d have to add a verb, like this, and say: <strong>I’m gonna go to Paris</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>I'm gonna go to Paris</strong>. Let’s have another clip with some more short spoken forms.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1      <br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jason<br/>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Yuki<br/></strong></span><span>I<strong> dunno. </strong>I’m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So Jason said <strong>whatcha</strong>. <strong>Whatcha</strong>. That’s a short form of <strong>what are you</strong>. Or sometimes <strong>what do you</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And Yuki said <strong>I dunno</strong>. <strong>I dunno</strong>. That’s a short spoken form of <strong>I don’t know</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have another clip. See if you can spot any more.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong></span><span>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Yuki<br/></strong></span><span>No, thanks. I’ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Did you get them? We heard <strong>wanna</strong>. That’s a short form of <strong>want to</strong>. <strong>Do you wanna come to the cinema in the afternoon</strong>? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And there was also <strong>gotta</strong>. <strong>Gotta</strong>.<strong> I’ve</strong><strong> gotta finish an English essay</strong>. Here, <strong>gotta</strong> is short for <strong>got to</strong>. But <strong>gotta</strong> can also be short for the possessive <strong>got a</strong>, like in <strong>I’ve gotta new mobile</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now for the last clip.</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong></span><span>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Can you guess what <strong>lemme</strong> is short for? It’s <strong>let me. Let me know if you change your mind.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And there are others like <strong>hafta</strong>,<strong> hafta</strong>, for <strong>have to</strong> or <strong>gimme</strong>, that's <strong>gimme</strong>, for <strong>give me</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now what about <strong>kinda</strong>, <strong>kinda</strong>, for <strong>kind of</strong>? Like <strong>She’s kinda nice</strong>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we’re talking about spoken short forms. So Catherine, <strong>whatcha gonna</strong> do in the quiz?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's go. Quiz question number one: what’s a more informal way to say <strong>I’ve got to phone the bank</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It’s <strong>I’ve gotta phone the bank</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Good. And number two: you want to know what your friend is doing tonight. How can you ask them, using a spoken short form?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>You could say: <strong>whatcha doing tonight</strong>?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And number three: you think it’s going to rain. Tell your friend using a spoken short form.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>You could say:<strong> I think it’s gonna rain</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. Now before we go, here’s a vocabulary tip. Try to watch TV, movies and video clips regularly in English. Listen out for short spoken forms and practise repeating them. It will help you to understand better when you listen and sound more natural when you speak.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>. We’ve <strong>gotta</strong> go now, but do join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><strong>Spoken short forms</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span><strong>Gonna, wanna, dunno, whatcha</strong>... are these really English words? Who uses them and why? Finn and Catherine give you an introduction to short spoken forms in 6 Minute Vocabulary.</span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-4/downloads\">Unit 4 Downloads </a>page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9xz/episodes/downloads\">podcast version</a>.</p>\n<h3>Vocabulary points to take away</h3>\n<p>Spoken short forms are ways of saying phrases quickly in informal situations. Some common examples are:</p>\n<p><strong>gonna - going to</strong><br/><em>I'm gonna watch a DVD.</em></p>\n<p><strong>wanna - want to<br/></strong><em>Do you wanna watch too?</em></p>\n<p><strong>whatcha - what are you</strong><br/><em>Whatcha doing?</em></p>\n<p><strong>dunno - don’t know</strong><br/><em>I dunno.</em></p>\n<p><strong>gotta - got to (or got a)</strong><br/><em>I've gotta go now.</em></p>\n<p><strong>hafta - have to</strong><br/><em>Do you hafta go already?</em></p>\n<p><strong>gimme - give me</strong><br/><em>Gimme a call tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p><strong>lemme - let me</strong><br/><em>Lemme know what you think.</em></p>\n<p><strong>kinda - kind of</strong><br/><em>She's kinda nice.</em></p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, there are lots of spoken short forms in informal English. In the next activity, you listen to a conversation and find all the short forms. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>I gotta practise these short forms...</h3>\n<p>In 6 Minute English we heard a lot of different spoken short forms. They're quite common in informal English, but you very rarely see them written down.</p>\n<p>So, how well do you know them? We're going to play you a short conversation between Finn and Rob with lots of short forms, and you have to find them.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>The conversation is six lines long. Listen to it at least twice, and write down any short forms you hear. Then, try to answer the questions in the quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Got that? Now for the quiz. Play the audio again if you need to.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done! Next there's a chance for you to practise the pronunciation of all these forms. Practice makes perfect, as they say. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Repeat after me...</h3>\n<p>This session is all about spoken English, so in this activity you'll have the chance to practise saying these short forms with Finn.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>In this listening and speaking activity, all you have to do is listen to Finn and repeat when he tells you to. There are gaps in the audio for you to speak in. Listen as many times as you like. There is a transcript, but it's best just to listen as carefully as possible - don't worry too much about how the words are spelt.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session. We hope you've enjoyed practising these short forms. In Session 2 we're looking at this unit's grammar - multi-word verbs. Don't <strong>let us down -</strong> join us and <strong>keep up with</strong> this useful area of grammar!</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar. I'm Finn…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we'll explain what they are and how you use them...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We'll have lots of examples and of course we'll finish with a quiz.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But first, let's listen to Mary. She's a lifestyle coach and she has some advice for us about friends and friendship.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And listen out for the answer to this question: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br/></strong>How often do you and your friends <strong>get together</strong>? In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let our </strong>friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>. Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by </strong>us when we need support. So while it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media, psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So that was Mary. And we asked: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: They say it's important for us and our friends to <strong>meet up</strong>. And I think they mean face to face. What do you think, Finn?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>They do. Face-to-face meeting up is the best thing, they say. And there's our first phrasal verb - <strong>meet up</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, meet up. Now, a phrasal verb is a two-word verb made of a verb plus a little word like <strong>in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, or<strong> up</strong>. We usually think of<strong> in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, and<strong> up</strong> as prepositions, but in phrasal verbs they behave more like adverbs.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>They do. In the phrasal verb <strong>meet up</strong>, the adverb <strong>up</strong> modifies the meaning of the verb <strong>meet</strong>. <strong>Meet</strong> and <strong>meet up</strong> are very similar in meaning. But the adverb sometimes does more than that. Listen to this clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Mary<br/></span></strong><span>...psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Right, we heard the phrasal verb <strong>point out</strong> there, but it doesn't mean the same as the verb <strong>point</strong>. <strong>Point out</strong> means to say something interesting, or unusual or useful. And the adverb changes the meaning significantly. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It does. Now listen out for more phrasal verbs in this clip.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mary   <br/></strong>In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let </strong>our friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now if we <strong>let</strong> our friends <strong>down</strong>, it means that we don't help or support them. And when we <strong>put off</strong> arrangements, we cancel or delay them. And if we <strong>ring</strong> people <strong>up</strong>, we phone them.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And those are interesting phrasal verbs because when they have an object, we can put the object either between the verb and the adverb, or we can put it after the adverb.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Like this: we can <strong>let our friends down</strong> or we can <strong>let down our friends</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>You wouldn't let your friends down.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I'd never let my friends down, Catherine. Or my colleagues.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we can <strong>put off arrangements</strong> or <strong>put arrangements off</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We can. But be careful. If the object is a pronoun, you have to put it in the middle. For example, you have to say <strong>ring them up</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. Don't say <strong>ring up them</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>No, don't say that. Now, one more clip. Can you spot any more phrasal verbs?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br/></strong></span><span>Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by us</strong> when we need support.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we just heard<strong> stand by us.</strong> And you are probably wondering why the pronoun is at the end of the verb because we just said that you can't put pronouns at the end. But <strong>stand by</strong> is a slightly different type of verb, because <strong>by</strong> isn't an adverb. It's a preposition.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. In some two-word verbs, the second word such as <strong>by</strong>,<strong> with</strong>,<strong> into</strong>, or<strong> on </strong>behaves like a preposition, not an adverb. And in these verbs, the object or object pronoun always comes after the preposition.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK. So Mary said that it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media. And <strong>keep up with</strong> means <strong>keep in contact with</strong>, and it's a phrasal verb made of three parts: a verb: <strong>keep</strong>, plus an adverb: <strong>up</strong>, plus a preposition: <strong>with</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And with phrasal verbs with three parts, the object always comes at the end. We <strong>keep up with people</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it's time for a quiz! Number one. Is this sentence correct or wrong? She took her coat off, hung it up and sat down. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number two: correct or wrong? We keep with each other up by phone and email.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that one is wrong...</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I know.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...sounds horrible! The correct sentence is: We keep up with each other by phone and email. So, number three: I turned down the job because it was too far away. Now the question is: can you also say a) I turned down it. Or b) I turned it down?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>Well, this time you can say b) I turned it down. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>You can.

And occasionally there's even a third word, as in <strong>break up with</strong>…</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>In this session we'll introduce you to the wonderful world of <strong>multi-word verbs</strong>, often known as <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>. There are lots of them in English and their meanings can be quite confusing - as</span></span><span><span> you might know, when we add a second word to the main verb it usually changes the meaning. Let's take a look at how this works with the main verb <strong>break</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read this short story about a man who decided to rob a bank. How many examples of multi-word verbs with <strong>break </strong>are there? And what do they mean?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Mark the monkey robber</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Mark broke in at midnight. He stuffed as much cash as he could into a sack and ran back to his car. But just as he was driving away, the car broke down.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Mark was caught and went to jail. But every day he thought of new ways to break out. Finally he escaped, dressed as a gorilla. But when he got home, his girlfriend broke up with him. She said she didn't want a man who robbed banks and dressed as a monkey.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do </span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>A sad ending for Mark. But did you count all four multi-word verbs? They were: to <strong>break in</strong>, to <strong>break down</strong>, to <strong>break out</strong> and to <strong>break up (with)</strong>. You might know some of them already. But just to make sure, let's do a test about their meanings. Can you work them out from the story?</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Grammar</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>So, as you've seen, these four multi-word verbs have different meanings. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>They are made of the main verb, <strong>break</strong>, and an adverb, like <strong>in</strong>, <strong>out</strong>, <strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong>. You might recognise <strong>in</strong>, <strong>up</strong>, <strong>out</strong> and <strong>down</strong> as prepositions, but here they behave more like adverbs. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>And some of them can be followed by a preposition, like <strong>with</strong>. Normally we say you <strong>break up 'with'</strong> someone.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Multiple meanings</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>And these aren't the only multi-word verbs with break. If you <strong>break away</strong> from a group, for example, you leave it. And how about to <strong>b</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>reak off</strong>? Well, it has three meanings:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>1) to separate something from something else<br/>He <strong>broke off</strong> a bit of naan bread to eat.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>2) to end a relationship<br/>They <strong>broke off</strong> their engagement after only a week.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>3) to suddenly stop speaking<br/>Magnus <strong>broke off</strong> in the middle of his sentence when his girlfriend walked in.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So as you can see, it's a huge topic. In fact, there are whole books just about phrasal verbs. For more help visit our grammar reference, which has more information about the form, meaning and use of multi-word verbs. </span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Next</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>So how do we begin to make sense of the world of multi-word verbs? One way is to learn them in groups by topic. That's what we'll do next, with the topic of travel. See you there!</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Set off, touch down, check in...</h3>\n<p>So far we've looked at a group of multi-word verbs that come from <strong>break</strong>. But with so many out there, what's the best way to learn them? Well, one way is to learn words in groups by topic. So, now we're going to do an exercise to practise multi-word verbs related to the theme of travel.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First, take a moment to learn these phrasal verbs related to travel.

Now, imagine that your boyfriend or girlfriend <strong>dumped</strong> you just before you were planning to go away. What would you do? Well, this actually happened to John Whitbread from Leicestershire in the UK. He was left with an extra ticket to the Dominican Republic after he <strong>split up</strong> with his girlfriend six weeks before they were going to get married.</p>\n<p>John Whitbread originally planned to get married on Valentine's Day but this changed when the couple<strong> </strong>ended their relationship over Christmas. Mr Whitbread had worked non-stop to pay for the cost of the trip, which came to just under £2,000. He went to the travel agent to see if he could <strong>get back</strong> any of the money that he had spent on the trip, but they only offered him a refund for half of the money.</p>\n<p>So, John was left with a <strong>spare</strong> ticket for a trip to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<h3>So, what's the problem?</h3>\n<p>Did you get it? John Whitbread has too many tickets to go to the Caribbean - he has an extra ticket because his girlfriend isn't coming.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Time to check your vocabulary knowledge!

He posted it on an auction website and was <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by the response. Soon he had 65 <strong>bidders</strong> competing for the chance to buy a ticket to a Caribbean paradise. But things did not go completely according to plan.</p>\n<p>Things were <strong>looking up</strong> when the auction closed and the highest bid of £8,000 had been made. However, it wasn't to be and the bidder failed to pay for the ticket. Mr Whitbread, who had been <strong>jilted </strong>by his fiancée before his wedding, was rejected again. And it got worse: he was disappointed yet again when the second-highest bidder for the honeymoon trip also <strong>pulled out</strong>.</p>\n<p>What could he do? Mr Whitbread decided to sell £10 raffle tickets for the chance to win the place on the trip and managed to raise £1,420 for the charity Balls to Cancer. The eventual winner was Kelly Wood from Suffolk. The pair didn't <strong>meet up</strong> in person until the actual day they <strong>went away</strong>. Mr Whitbread said that not meeting before the trip would make it more fun.</p>\n<h3>Did you work out what John did next?</h3>\n<p>He auctioned - or put up for sale - his extra ticket.

I only recently split up with my girlfriend.\"</p>\n<p>But he added: \"I've made a friend out of it and it's brilliant. It could have easily gone the other way.

In this case, we're going to learn how to make a complaint when you're staying in a hotel. A polite complaint, of course! </br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So, picture the scene – you're on holiday, you're in your hotel room, but there are a few problems: the kettle is not working, there aren't any slippers, and there's no hot water. What to do? Are there any strategies, or special words and phrases that you could use? Well, yes, there are.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>So, how about this: we'll do a small roleplay – I'll be the receptionist… (clears throat) the receptionist, there we are – and I'll wait for the guests to call me with their problems. Listen out for how they complain – do they say the problem straight away? Ooh, there's the phone now.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Hello, reception?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Hello reception. It's Mr Carter here. I checked into the room on the 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> floor just a few minutes ago actually. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Okay.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Yeah, well, everything's fine, it's a lovely room, but the problem, you know, is, I was really desperate for a drink and the mini-bar's empty.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>It's me again. That sounded a bit like Rob. Anyway, his mini-bar was empty, that was his problem. But he didn't tell me the problem straight away. First, he gave the background, he set the scene, he told me a little story, about how he checked into the room a few minutes ago, and everything was fine, he even gave a compliment – that it was a lovely room… And he also gave a reason for needing the minibar – that he was desperate for a drink. Listen again:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>It's Mr Carter here. I checked into the room on the 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> floor just a few minutes ago actually. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Okay.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Yeah, well, everything's fine, it's a lovely room, but the problem is, I was really desperate for a drink and the mini-bar's empty.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>So, this is quite common – people don't go straight into the problem, first they tell the story – how they came to the problem. Now, sadly, the lack of cold drinks isn't Rob's only problem here. Let's listen to a bit more of the conversation. What's wrong this time?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Well there is one more thing.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Right.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>Because I couldn't get a drink out of the mini-bar I was trying to make a cup of tea, but the kettle isn’t working.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Ah. Right.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>I filled it up with water and plugged it in, and I've switched the switch on, but it doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working, really.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>Yes. This time the kettle's not working. Again he told a story – about why he wanted to use the kettle – to make a cup of tea. And then he said how he tried and failed to use it successfully. But there's more – listen to this phrase. What does he say instead of 'it's not working'?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Rob</strong> <br/>It doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working, really.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong> <br/>It doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working. Now, that's a softer way of saying 'it's not working'. In fact, he doesn't directly say that it's not working at all – when he says it doesn't <strong>seem to</strong> be working, it's as if there's even a possibility that it's Rob's fault. So this is a very soft way of making a complaint. </span></span><span><span>You'll hear <strong>seem to</strong> quite often. It's often used with a negative auxiliary like <strong>can't</strong> or <strong>doesn't.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>The hot water <strong>doesn't seem to</strong> be working.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>I <strong>can't seem to</strong> find any slippers in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>But you can also use it in a positive sentence with no auxiliary.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>There <strong>seems to</strong> be a problem with the hot water.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>There <strong>seem to</strong> be no slippers in here.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>And there's another phrase which is very similar: <strong>appear to</strong>. Again with a negative auxiliary:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>There <strong>don't</strong> <strong>appear to</strong> be any slippers in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>The hot water <strong>doesn't</strong> <strong>appear to</strong> be working.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>And in a positive sentence with no auxiliary:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>There <strong>appears to</strong> be a problem with the hot water.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Mike</strong> <br/>There <strong>appear to</strong> be no slippers in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>So – those are my two tips: tell a bit of a story, give a bit of background before going into your problem or complaint. And use phrases like <strong>seem to</strong> or<strong> appear to</strong> to soften your language. </span></span><span><span>But remember – you do need to make your point clear, even though you're being polite.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Well that's it from me, but I'll leave you with one more conversation to listen to. <strong>Catherine</strong> seems to be having a problem in her room - and what is it with slippers in this hotel?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Hello. Yes, reception. Can I help you?</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Hello. Yes, it's <strong>Catherine</strong> here. I'm in room 207.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Hi there.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>I wonder if you can help me? I've got a couple of problems.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Okay.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>I've been running a bath and the water's cold. I can't get any hot water.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Oh, I'm very sorry about that. I'll send someone to have a look at that right away. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Thank you, if you would, that would be great.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Yes, of course.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong> <span><span><br/>Thank you very much. And something else I've spotted, actually, is, in the room there <strong>don't seem to</strong> be any slippers.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <br/><span><span>No slippers, huh?</span></span></p>\n<p><span></span><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>No, I'm afraid not, no. There's normally a pair of little paper slippers aren’t there? And I just can't find them anywhere…</p> </div>",

Things don't always go our way, so being able to make a complaint is a useful skill in any language. But how do you do it effectively and politely in English?</p>\n<p>The British are famed for their politeness, so let's listen to Finn and the Learning English team as they do some roleplays in a fictional hotel. Which phrases do native English speakers use when they are complaining?</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to the programme. What is missing from both Rob and Catherine's hotel rooms?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download the programme and transcript from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-4/downloads\">Unit 4 Downloads</a> page.</p>\n<h3>Language tips</h3>\n<p>So what was missing from Rob and Catherine's rooms? Slippers! Essential in any good hotel room.</p>\n<p>Now let's remind ourselves of the language tips and tricks that can help us to make better complaints:</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Tell a story</strong></h3>\n<p>Don't go straight into your problem or complaint. Give a little background first, so the listener understands your situation better. Don't make it too long though! Here are two good examples from the programme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I checked into the room on the 4th floor just a few minutes ago. It's a lovely room, but the problem is that I was really desperate for a drink and the mini-bar's empty.</li>\n<li>Because I couldn't get a drink out of the mini-bar I was trying to make a cup of tea, but<br/>the kettle isn’t working.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2) Use softening language</h3>\n<p>Instead of directly saying that something is bad or not working, you can soften it by using <strong>seem to</strong> or <strong>appear to</strong>.</p>\n<p>The form is <strong>seem to + infinitive +</strong> <strong>the problem</strong></p>\n<p>Often, the infinitive is <strong>be</strong>. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sorry, there <strong>seems to</strong> <strong>be</strong> a problem with the radio.</li>\n<li>Excuse me, there <strong>appears to</strong> <strong>be</strong> a problem with your ticket.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And these sentences, in the negative, take auxiliaries like <strong>can't</strong> and <strong>don't</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I <strong>can't seem to</strong> switch on the TV.</li>\n<li>There <strong>don't appear to</strong> be any slippers in the room.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This was our second special programme teaching you functional language. The first was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-1/session-4\">how to haggle</a>, in Unit 1 of this course.</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So, those are our two top tips for making complaints. Would you like to try your knowledge of this language? Test yourself in our quiz, next.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>... there don't seem to be any!</h3>\n<p>You've heard Rob and Catherine complaining about the lack of slippers in their rooms. Poor things, we don't want their feet to get cold! And if you're ever in the same position, we hope that the tips you learned mean you won't get cold feet either. Remember, if you want to be both polite and firm:</p>\n<p>1) Give a bit of background before you talk about the problem</p>\n<p>2) Use phrases like <strong>seem to</strong> and <strong>appear to</strong> to soften your language</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>So, now it's your turn to put this new language to the test. We're going to give you some possible problems with a hotel room, and you have to choose the answer which is both polite and firm, according to our programme! How many successful complaints can you make?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session. We hope you enjoyed it, and have no complaints.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And me, Neil. And today we're talking about ordinal numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. So numbers like <strong>first, second </strong>and <strong>third</strong>. So let's start by listening to Laurence. He's talking about his 18th birthday party. While you listen, try to answer this question: What date was his party? Here's Laurence.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Laurence<br/></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives! It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party. It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we asked you: What date was Laurence's birthday party?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. Now <strong>the twenty-fifth</strong> is an ordinal number like <strong>the</strong> <strong>first</strong> and <strong>the</strong> <strong>second</strong>. Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group - the dates in a month, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or which birthday it is. Laurence said it was his <strong>eighteenth</strong> birthday.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, he did. Lucky him! And ordinal numbers are different to cardinal numbers. We use cardinal numbers like <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong>, <strong>three</strong> for counting and to answer the question <strong>how many</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And to make a cardinal number into an ordinal number, add the letters <strong>t-h</strong> to the end of the cardinal number. <strong>Eighteen - eighteenth; sixty - sixtieth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And that works for all the cardinal numbers except for <strong>first, second </strong>and<strong> third</strong> – they're irregular, but for all the others, it's add <strong>t-h, </strong>so that's<strong> fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Eighth, ninth, tenth</strong>. So that's good but in writing we do have a couple of irregular spellings, such as <strong>fifth:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>f-i-f-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>eighth</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>e-i-g-h-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>ninth</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>n-i-n-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>twelfth</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>t-w-e-l-f-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And for numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>like <strong>sixty</strong>, drop the <strong>-y</strong> and add <strong>-i-e </strong>and<strong> -t-h </strong>to make<strong> sixtieth:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>s-i-x-t-i-e-t-h</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's look more closely at dates. Listen for the date in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>The twenty-fifth of May</strong>. When we say the day before the month, we always use the words <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>: <strong>the twenty-fifth of May</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But when we say the month before the day, we don't use the word <strong>of</strong>. It's just <strong>May the twenty-fifth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We often use the word <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers, but we can also use possessives. In this next clip, Laurence uses the possessive adjective <strong>my</strong> before <strong>eighteenth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></strong>It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, now we have two more ways of using ordinal numbers: space and quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, we do. And <strong>the third floor</strong> tells us about the position of the floors in space. It's the same as when we give directions, for example: <strong>Take the second left after the traffic lights.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>second prize</strong> tells us about the quality. And a point to make here is that ordinal numbers can be used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the. </strong>Like in the phrase <strong>he won second prize. Second </strong>is an adjective.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And now it's quiz time! Number one: Which of these is correct? The party's on: a) thirtieth of July b) the thirtieth July c) the thirtieth of July.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's c) the thirtieth of July.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Great! Now, number two. Which word in this list is wrong? First, second, third, ford, fifth.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>The answer's <strong>ford</strong>. It should be <strong>fourth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it should! Number three: Which of these is correct? a) My twenty-first birthday b) My the twenty-first birthday c) The my twenty-first birthday.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The answer's a) My twenty-first birthday.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done if you got them right. But before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Try saying your own important and memorable dates in English, for example, birthdays, anniversaries and festivals. If the dates are important, you're more likely to remember the English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

They are used for:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Dates</strong><br/><em>It's <strong>the twelfth of November</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>2. The order of events</strong><br/><em>Her <strong>fiftieth birthday</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>3.

Order of quality</strong><br/><em>The <strong>first prize</strong> in the competition</em></p>\n<h3>Spelling and form</h3>\n<p>We usually form ordinal numbers by adding -<strong>th</strong> to cardinal numbers:<br/><strong>four - fourth<br/></strong><strong>first, second</strong> and <strong>third</strong> are irregular forms<br/><strong>fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth </strong>and numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>have irregular spellings: <strong>twentieth</strong></p>\n<p>We say dates with <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>:<br/><strong><em>the eighth of</em></strong><em> Apr</em><em>il</em><br/><em>April <strong>the eighth </strong></em></p>\n<p>But we don't write them like that. We write them as:<br/><strong><em>8th April</em></strong><br/><strong><em>April 8th</em></strong><br/><strong><em>8 April</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>First, second</strong> and <strong>third</strong> have the irregular suffixes <strong>1st, 2nd </strong>and<strong> 3rd</strong></p>\n<p>We usually use the definite article <strong>the</strong> with ordinal numbers:<strong><br/></strong><em>on <strong>the third</strong> day</em><br/><em>It was <strong>the first</strong> time I've ever been to France</em></p>\n<p>But sometimes we use possessives:<br/><em><strong>my thirtieth</strong> birthday</em><br/><em><strong>Julia's second</strong> child</em></p>\n<p>Ordinal numbers are also used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the</strong> or a possessive adjective.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>That's the <strong>first</strong> activity over and done with. We hope you liked listening to 6 Minute Vocabulary. On to the <strong>second </strong>activity now - have a go at an ordinal numbers spelling quiz!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Eigth, eigthth, eighth?</h3>\n<p>As you heard in 6 Minute Vocabulary, spelling some ordinal numbers can be tricky. Take another look at our guidelines, and then try our spelling quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Spelling</h3>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> We usually form ordinal numbers by adding the suffix <strong>-th</strong> to cardinal numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>four - fourth</strong></li>\n<li><strong>eleven - eleventh</strong></li>\n<li><strong>thirty-seven - thirty-seventh</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> If we are writing using numbers, which we often do for dates and numbers over 10, we simply add the suffix <strong>-th</strong> to the number:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4th</strong></li>\n<li><strong>11th</strong></li>\n<li><strong>37th</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> One, two and three have irregular forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>first, second, third </strong></li>\n<li><strong>1st, 2nd, 3rd</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> So do five, eight, nine, and twelve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth </strong></li>\n<li><strong>5th, 8th, 9th, 12th</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Numbers ending in <strong>-y</strong> have irregular spellings. They drop the <strong>-y</strong> and replace it with <strong>-ieth:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>twentieth, fortieth, seventieth</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Large numbers also follow this pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>the hundredth time</strong></li>\n<li><strong>the thousandth man</strong></li>\n<li><strong>every billionth customer</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Do you remember all those rules? Prove your spelling power in our quiz.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Now it's time to test how well you know how to use ordinals in dates, and how to use them with articles and possessives. Ready?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Dates and ordinals</h3>\n<p>So far you've listened to 6 Minute English and practised spelling ordinal numbers. Now let's practise using dates correctly.</p>\n<p>This is where Marcus comes in. He's a very disorganised man. He's always losing his diary and getting confused about dates. Which is bad for him - but good for us, because it lets us practise more ordinals!</p>\n<p>We're going to read a short story about Marcus, then answer some questions. But first, let's review:</p>\n<h3><span><span>Remember</span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>We often <strong>say</strong> dates with <strong>the </strong>and <strong>of</strong>: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>the eighth of April </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But we can also say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><strong><span>April the eighth </span></strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span>(And<strong> April eighth </strong>in American English)</span></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>But we don't write them like that. We write them as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>8th April </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>April 8th </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><strong><span>8 April </span></strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span>(On the BBC website we use the last kind in news reports)</span></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>We usually use the definite article <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span>on<strong> the first evening </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\">The<strong><span> second time </span></strong>I tried sushi</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span>But sometimes we use possessives: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"Default\"><span><strong>my seventieth birthday </strong></span></div>\n</li>\n<li><strong><span>Bob's second </span>car</strong></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read Marcus' story and then answer the questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions 1-3 will test spoken forms</li>\n<li>Questions 4-5 will test written forms of dates</li>\n<li>Questions 6 and 7 will look at ordinals with possessives</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will only be one possible correct answer each time.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><span><span><span><span>Poor Marcus. Well, let's hope his bad memory means his wife gets more presents, not fewer!</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span><span><span>Please note</span></span></span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Although you selected some different written forms in the test, we recommend you don't mix different forms in your essays or business communications. You should pick one form - and stick to it. Consistency is much more professional.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>End of Session 1</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>And that's the end of the <strong>first</strong> session in this unit. We hope you enjoyed it, and that you now feel a bit more confident about using ordinals in English.</span></span></p></div>",

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>Now, Catherine, would you like to have some of this delicious chocolate I've got here? </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Oh Neil, I'd love to but I can't. When I eat chocolate, I get terrible headaches. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>Oh that's bad luck! If I eat a lot of chocolate, I just get fat! </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Do you? You don't look it, you look thin!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>It's all the cycling you see. I can eat whatever I want because of all the cycling.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Lucky you.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, in this programme, we're looking at the zero conditional and the first conditional.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>We'll be discussing why and when we use them.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll see how to form them...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>We'll help you decide which one to use in which situation...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>And we'll bring you a quiz at the end of the show.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So listen carefully - and take some notes!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>Let's start by looking at the zero conditional. We use it to talk about things which always happen in particular situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>For example,<strong> I always get a headache if I eat chocolate.</strong> We also use the zero conditional to talk about facts and truths. And here's Finn with our first example.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong><strong>If you drop an apple, it falls to the ground.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>That's gravity for you! Now, there are two parts to the sentence. The part with <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>present simple</strong> tells us the situation, and the other part is in the present simple tense, and tells us what happens as a result of the<strong> if</strong> situation. Here's Finn with an example of the <strong>if</strong> situation:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong><strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>\n<p>And I'll say that again: <strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And the result:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Once more:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>And this result happens every time the situation happens. Isn't that right, Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>That's correct Neil. It's a scientific fact - and it was first identified by Isaac Newton, I believe.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>I think you're right! So that's the zero conditional. Let's compare it with an example of the first conditional. Finn.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And once again:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Now, in this sentence the <strong>if</strong> plus present simple part gives us a possible future situation. The other part is made with <strong>will</strong> plus an <strong>infinitive</strong> <strong>without 'to'</strong> and it gives us the result of this possible future situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>And this is only a possible situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>And this is the result of the situation. We use <strong>will</strong> to show we are certain that the glass will break. But it only breaks if we drop the glass.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>When we are less certain of the result we can use <strong>might</strong>, like this: </p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And once again:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>It's sometimes difficult to choose between the zero and first conditional. It helps to remember that as well as using the zero conditional for truths, we also use it for general situations. If you're talking about a specific situation, or a one-off situation, the first conditional is probably best. For example, to describe a general situation that is true for everyone, we can use the zero conditional to say:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you get burned.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But if your friend is about to go sunbathing, perhaps without any sun cream, you can use the first conditional to talk about that specific situation and its possible result, like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you will get burned.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>And it's quiz time! Are these sentences grammatically correct, or wrong? Here's the first one: When we're older, we'll go travelling.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>OK, this first conditional sentence is correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Good. Here's another one: If plants don't get water, they die. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>This sentence is correct too. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>OK, get ready for the last sentence: If I fail my exams again, I feel terrible. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>And that's wrong. It's a specific situation and it's describing a possibility, not a certainty. So we need the first conditional. Here's the correct sentence:<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>  <br/>If I fail my exams again, I<strong> will </strong>feel terrible.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Now, before we go, there's just enough time for a top tip. The first conditional only has one 'will'. So this sentence is wrong:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>  <br/>If <strong>they will leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>You need to use present simple without will in the <strong>if</strong> part. Here's the correct version:</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>  <br/>If <strong>they leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Thank you Finn. So that's the zero conditional, with the present tense in both parts, for things which always happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong>   <br/>And that's the first conditional with <strong>if</strong> plus present simple, together with <strong>will</strong>, plus an infinitive, for possible future situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong>Both</strong> <br/>Bye.</p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>... you'll get better!</h3>\n<p>If you practise, you'll get better... I'm sure you agree with that statement. But is it the zero or first conditional? That's the grammar we're looking at in this session.</p>\n<p>Let's start by comparing the two, then we'll do a test to see how well you know the form. </p>\n<h3>If / when + result</h3>\n<p>Conditional sentences have two parts: the <strong>if</strong> or <strong>when</strong> part and the result <strong>(main)</strong> part.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When she eats</strong> too much cake, <strong>she feels</strong> bad. (zero conditional)</li>\n<li><strong>I'll take</strong> my swimsuit <strong>if we go</strong> to the beach. (first conditional)</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Zero conditional</h3>\n<p>We use this to talk about things that are always true, whether they are scientific fact or personal beliefs. Both parts are in the present simple.</p>\n<p>The zero conditional uses <strong>if / when</strong> <strong>+ present simple</strong>, and <strong>present simple</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If</strong> <strong>I drink</strong> milk, <strong>I get</strong> a stomachache.</li>\n<li><strong>When you take</strong> exercise, <strong>your heart beats</strong> faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I</strong> <strong>feel</strong> upset <strong>when</strong> <strong>he</strong> <strong>doesn't answer</strong> my calls.</li>\n<li><strong>If you</strong> <strong>mix</strong> white and yellow<strong>,</strong> <strong>you don't get</strong> orange.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What comes </strong>out of a volcano<strong> when it erupts</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>First conditional</h3>\n<p>We use this to talk about things which might happen if an action takes place. We use <strong>if</strong> for things which are likely to happen and <strong>when</strong> for things which are certain to happen.</p>\n<p>It uses <strong>if</strong> <strong>/ when</strong> <strong>+ present simple</strong>, and <strong>will + infinitive (without 'to')</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I'll do</strong> the cooking this evening <strong>if it's</strong> OK with you.</li>\n<li><strong>When they finish</strong> work, <strong>they'll go</strong> home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I won't wait</strong> for you, <strong>if you're</strong> late again.</li>\n<li><strong>When we go</strong> camping, <strong>we won't</strong> take our laptops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where will he live when he moves</strong> to the city?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>if / when</strong> part can also come second in zero and first conditional sentences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I get a stomachache <strong>if</strong> I drink milk.</li>\n<li>They'll go home <strong>when</strong> they finish work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>That's a brief introduction to the form. So do you think you can spot sentences which are grammatically correct and wrong? Find out in our test!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next it's time to test how well you can use them. When do you use the zero and when do you use the first conditional?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Which conditional do you use, if you want to get it right?</h3>\n<p>Now that you've had a look at the form of the zero and first conditionals, let's think about choosing the right one to use.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Facts</h3>\n<p>When we talk about things that are considered as facts, we use the <strong>zero conditional</strong>. We also use this form for things that we believe are always true.</p>\n<p><strong><em>When you take</em></strong><em> exercise, <strong>your heart beats</strong> faster.<br/></em><strong><em>If I drink</em></strong><em> milk, <strong>I get</strong> stomachache.<br/></em><br/>And we can use<strong> if </strong>or<strong> when </strong>with the same meaning:</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you take </em></strong><em>exercise,<strong> your heart beats </strong>faster.<strong><br/>When I drink</strong> milk,<strong> I get</strong> stomachache.</em></p>\n<h3>Possibilities</h3>\n<p>If we want to talk about something which might happen as the result of an action or situation, we use the <strong>first conditional</strong>. We use <strong>if</strong> for things which are likely to happen and <strong>when</strong> for things which are more certain to happen.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If I see</em></strong><em> Freddy later, I’<strong>ll give</strong> him the book. </em>(I’m not certain I’ll see him.)<em><br/></em><strong><em>When I see</em></strong><em> Freddy later, I’<strong>ll give </strong>him the book. </em>(I’m certain I’ll see him.)</p>\n<p><strong><em>If we go</em></strong><em> to the beach, I’<strong>ll take </strong>my swimsuit. </em>(It isn’t certain we’ll go to the beach.)<strong><em><br/>When we go</em></strong><em> to the beach, I’<strong>ll take </strong>my swimsuit.</em> (It is certain we’ll go to the beach.)</p>\n<h3>Changes in meaning</h3>\n<p>Be careful! Sometimes you can use the zero or first conditional and both sentences sound acceptable and are grammatically correct. But which conditional form you use changes the meaning of the sentence and the context you're using it in. Take a look at the two examples in the picture.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>get</strong> burned. </em>(Zero conditional)<em><br/><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>will get</strong> burned. </em>(First conditional)</p>\n<p>In this case, it is important to think about what you are trying to say. Is it something that is generally true - like the zero conditional sentence? Or is it something that is the result of an action or situation - like the first conditional sentence? Here is an explanation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>get</strong> burned. </em>(This is something that is generally true - too much sun gives people sunburn.)<em><br/><strong>If you sit</strong> in the sun too long, you <strong>will get</strong> burned. </em>(This is the possible result of an action - like you are giving a friend some advice about being in the sun too long.)</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Right! Here is a quiz to test how well you understand the use of the zero and first conditionals. Can you work out which to use?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Your knowledge of zero and first conditional form and meaning should be pretty good now! And if you keep studying this session, you will find 6 Minute Grammar! It's in the next activity - Neil, Catherine and Finn will help you make sense of all your conditional learning.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>Zero and first conditionals</strong></h3>\n<p>Neil and Catherine take a look at the zero and first conditionals. Learn how to make them and when to use them, listen to some example sentences and test what you've learnt in the quiz at the end of the programme.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Grammar from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-5/downloads\">Unit 5 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/6min_gram\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong>End of Session 2</strong></h3>\n<p>That's all for this session.

You've joined us at an exciting time in the history of Tip Top Trading - the leading manufacturer of plastic imitation fruit. There's been some restructuring and Paul, the boss, has gone and been replaced by a new dynamic manager, Anna, who has some big ideas...</br></p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Morning everyone. Hope you all had a lovely weekend...</p>\n<p>[everyone grunts a reply] </p>\n<p>...good, good. Now I've been thinking over the weekend...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah, yeah, she has - but not about what to cook for dinner or where to go on holiday!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Hmm Tom, we might be married now but let's not talk about personal matters in the office. No as I was <em>trying</em> to say, I was thinking about how to make our life in the office better. We need to talk more...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Doesn't Denise do enough talking already?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Thank you Tom.  No, I think we need to mix you all up a bit... so it's time to try hot desking.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>Hot desking?! You mean not having my own desk? Just sitting at whichever one is free? I can't do that! I'd have to move my staplers and my rubbers and pens and souvenir snow globe from Egypt.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Yeah... and what about my bad back? I can't keep changing desks every day...</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Come on Anna, it's time to take control. Stop them moaning - get them to love your new idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>But how? What can I say?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Well, be polite but be firm and say things like...</p>\n<p><strong>It would be great if you could</strong> try it.<br/><strong>I'd really appreciate it if you could</strong> have a go for a trial period. </p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Right thanks - I'll have a go.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>That's the spirit Anna!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So Anna - yeah, this hot desking is your 'big idea' yeah? I've never known it work before and, quite frankly, it's going to be a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Tom, you remember when I cooked rhubarb crumble for you and you said you'd never eat anything red?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah... so?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Well, you gave it a try - in the end you liked it, didn't you?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>Well... erm... [lost for words]</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Well, <strong>it would be great if you could</strong> give this idea a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>But I like my desk - I get to look out of the window at all the hunky builders.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>You don't Denise?!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>Look Denise - <strong>I'd really appreciate it if you</strong> would have a go... for a trial period. So come on... stand up everyone... let's hot desk... [small commotion/groans]</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>[grumpily] I'll just put my things in this box shall I...</p>\n<p><strong>Tom<br/></strong>[moving around] Denise, I'll go and sit in your chair then - just for today. [sitting down] Ooo, your chair feels hot - is that why they call it <em>hot</em> desking?! Oi, you've left your snow globe behind. [starts to shake it] Ooh!</p>\n<p><strong>Denise<br/></strong>I'll take that thank you Tom... and what about you Anna? Are you still going to sit in your cosy warm office?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong>No Denise - I'm going to lead by example - I'm going to hot desk too - I'm going to sit... erm... over here... oh dear!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>Are you OK Anna - you sound shocked?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna<br/></strong><em>This</em> desk is filthy - there are crumbs all over it and... old coffee cups too. Oh dear.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>I think you need to lay down some ground rules about keeping desks tidy.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Ground rules?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator<br/></strong>The basic rules that everyone needs to follow.

Getting on with our day-to-day tasks is difficult enough without having to deal with other people’s bad behaviour. Here’s an article that looks at the difficult people we may have to work with – colleagues from hell – and shares some tips about how to deal with them.</p>\n<p>While you’re reading, decide which of these is the main conclusion of the article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to learn to live with difficult colleagues - it's part of the job. </li>\n<li>Talk through problems with difficult colleagues - it might help the situation.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>We all have to work together</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can choose our friends, but we can't always choose our colleagues - and that can cause big problems. Today's <strong>open-plan offices</strong> make it easy to meet up with colleagues and <strong>collaborate</strong> on projects - but there's a <strong>downside</strong> to working closely together. The open-plan office makes it much harder to avoid people who have difficult or <strong>disruptive</strong> personalities. One recent high-profile case of co-worker problems featured BBC Top Gear presenter, Jeremy Clarkson. He reportedly <strong>abused</strong> a producer who failed to provide him with a hot meal after filming. Star cricketer Kevin Pietersen is another celebrity who has upset the people he works with: his teammates in the England international cricket team. Clarkson and Pietersen are valuable in their own ways – they are a huge <strong>draw</strong>. But many people believe that celebrities shouldn't <strong>get away with</strong> bad behaviour just because they are talented or popular - and it seems that their employers agree. Clarkson's contract wasn't renewed and Pietersen is off the England team, at least<strong> for the time being</strong>.</p>\n<h3>When they wind us up</h3>\n<p>So what about the office environment? You may not share office space with Clarkson or Pietersen, and there are plenty of benefits to working together, but people working side by side might irritate each other by their behaviour. Office <strong>gripes</strong> include: colleagues eating smelly food, untidiness, raised voices, poor <strong>personal hygiene</strong> and even rude behaviour. There might be <strong>inane</strong> conversation about what was on TV the night before, or you might be forced to listen to colleagues arguing on the phone.</p>\n<p>Most people would agree that it is very difficult, even impossible, to listen to what two people are saying at the same time. When other people are talking and you are trying to work, you can forget about concentrating on the task you are doing. A 1998 study in the British Journal of Psychology also found that background noise containing <strong>irrelevant</strong> speech affected workers' ability to memorise prose and do mental arithmetic.</p>\n<h3>Top tips for dealing with difficult people</h3>\n<p>So what should you do if you have to work with the colleague from hell? How can you get them to change their behaviour? And if your difficult colleague is liked by others at your workplace, can you air your grievances? We asked our audience on social media for advice. Here are five top tips inspired by their comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to be friendly to them and give them advice. If you explain to them how their actions are affecting other people, they might change their behaviour.</li>\n<li>Don't use bad language or behaviour yourself. Always <strong>maintain</strong> your professional <strong>dignity</strong> whatever your colleague does.</li>\n<li>You shouldn't let their behaviour <strong>influence</strong> what you do. Just because they are rude or aggressive, it doesn't mean that you can act the same way yourself.</li>\n<li>Keep smiling! Don't let them get you down! If they annoy you, count to ten and breathe deeply before you react.</li>\n<li>Just ignore them. They are not worth the time and effort to deal with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's no doubt that it is not always easy for us to get on with our work colleagues, but for many of us there is no <strong>alternative</strong>. Dialogue with the people we have to work with is the way to make sure that it doesn't get too bad. Here's to a happier, more productive workplace!</p>\n<h3>Did you work out the main conclusion?</h3>\n<p>It was: Talk through problems with difficult colleagues - it might help the situation.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Time to tackle those tricky colleague questions.

Go to the next activity and share your experiences about your own tricky colleagues.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Over to you!</h3>\n<p>You've read about dealing with difficult colleagues in general, so now it's your turn to tell us your experiences. Have you ever had to put up with a tricky co-worker?

Do they distract everyone when you're trying to work? Write down a description and try to use this unit's grammar and vocabulary as much as you can.</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Mona, Egypt</h3>\n<p>I used to have this co-worker who was bugging me all the time, sticking her nose into my business and it went too far till she deliberately made my manager angry with me. I couldn't bare it any longer. I was overwhelmed with this trouble-maker behaviour and that's when I asked her frankly to stop nagging me. I believe if I hadn't done that, she would have never stopped. </p>\n<h3>Rita, Spain</h3>\n<p>I remember the last company where I worked in. I'd not say I had tricky colleagues there but they got me down because their only interest was to give a wonderful  company appearance  to the customers while the quality level of our products was quite bad, at least at the beggining.</p>\n<p>I was the only technical worker in a marketing department, sometimes they manteined conversations about inane themes while i had to help a customer on the phone with problems relating our hardware or software. I had to ask them to lower their volume to be able to hear the customer at the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>I think everything would have been much easier if I had worked in R+D department or production department. I would say it was a question of \"tricky department\" instead of tricky colleagues.</p>\n<h3><strong>Rodrigo, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>I work in Brazil and here we have all the situations mentioned in the article, mainly unimportant conversations during work time. The productivity is not really our strength point.</p>\n<p>Our present economic situation is very bad and I hope people understand the need of higher productivity to tackle the moment.</p>\n<h3>Vladimir, Russia</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of communication problems with our co-workers at work. Bad-tempered colleagues usually irritate and annoy us, their disruptive personality usually gets us down. The perfect advice can be only one - try to put off with them. We should collaborate on tasks together to find the point of collaboration. This is an idea. In my working life I usually have to cope with great stress and sometimes people behaviors are irrational and difficult to understand, but I always do my best to get on with them for the future relations and projects. You never know today what will be tomorrow!</p>\n<h3>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>It is true that we can choose the friends but we cannot choose our colleagues and there are always some difficult ones among them that we have to put up with in our working life.</p>\n<p>I used to have a good job but I quit it however good the pay was. The reason was very simple: there was a hard smoker in the office. He often broke the etiquette \"no smoking in the office\". \"You save money if you stop smoking\" we advised him, \"Your lung will be damaged if you smoke too much\" we warned him. He did not give up his habit. \"It would be great if you could stop smoking in the office\", \"Would you mind smoking outside the office\", \"We would appreciate it if you could keep our office free from smoke in one single day\"... we requested him politely. We tried lots alternatives and expected that he stopped smoking for his health and us as well. But we failed and I quit the job because I was clearly aware of negative influence of passive smoking and I did not want to be killed by his smoke.</p>\n<p>I personally believe that every ones have to put up with colleagues from hell. Some people chooses to learn to live with. Others choose to quit as me. How’s about you? </p>\n<h3>Gian Piero, Italy</h3>\n<p>Almost everyone had to cope with some difficult colleagues in his worklife. As for me, I always tried getting on well with all of them, thinking that it was part of the job. A few years after, when I was entrusted with the management and responsibility of the office,  then I believed it was my assignment to try changing someone's behavior. Not publicly, but face to face in a polite way. I was lucky and I succeeded in the task.</p>\n<h3>Gerard</h3>\n<p>For my first job, I worked for an air plane company and discovered the hot desking.</p>\n<p>In fact, I really appreciated it because I was young, so it was a way to meet people.</p>\n<p>My job was to answer phone calls and I remembered that we had fun. Between two phone calls, we could laugh and also make fun of our clients.</p>\n<p>But today, It might be different. I would not bear people who don't respect the work of their collegues, speaking too much high, eating dirtily or having bad behaviour.</p>\n<p>I'm completely agree with the fact that we have to put up with and try to improve situation trying to ignore them or understand them. If It would be today, I would appreciate a personal desk.</p>\n<p>I love meet people but only when I decide it. For my opinion, we should not have friends at work, it might cause problems. If I had choice, I would not work in open space offices.</p>\n<h3>Jose</h3>\n<p>Well, you know it's not really easy to share habits with your colleagues. At the beginning of the article was the key: you can choose your friends but you can't choose your co-workers.</p>\n<p>I remember a colleague who left the office and she went to buy a lot of things for home. There was another one who told everybody a lot of lies every day. Nowadays, there's a colleague who have snack and lunch at the desk cutting the bread with a knife and drinking some beer. Yes, it's completely true. Also he's a rude man. But I'd rather say that the most of my colleagues have been really great, polite and patient with me.</p>\n<h3>Olga, Russia</h3>\n<p>Sometimes life might turn so funny side. We are talking about our colleagues who have bad personality or don't use personal hygiene. But we don't think about one thing that we could be exactly this colleague from a hell.</p>\n<p>I used to work in the office where was a common kitchen. One day I brought a very smelly fish. I understood this fact only when I began to eat it. Of course the smell was going around all our office. It was so embarassing and I tried to do something. The worse thing was that my boss came to the kitchen and asked loudly without any etiquette \"What's smell so bad and who did it?\". No one did not answer, but my face was so red!!! I thought that I lost my dignity.</p>\n<p>The funny thing that  my boss brings very smelly food everyday and nodody can't say to him anything because of shying. Just we wait when he finishes to eat and than open the windows and joke behind his back. When I was on his situation, I would like that someone tell me something like: \"I'd really approciate it if you could eat so nice food at your home\" and \"Would you mind helping to make air more fresh?\". And we could laugh about this situation together.</p>\n<h3>Anderson, Bogota, Colombia</h3>\n<p>We are 12 persons in the office, but I have one partner that always smell really bad, I want to say her something about it but is really embarrassing, in fact she is a beautiful woman and she actually works just by my side, I'm tired of the situation and is absolutely frustrating that one person so beautiful had this bad habits.</p>\n<h3>Suzy</h3>\n<p>We were only two in the office but when I began to work with my colleague, I had problems.</p>\n<p>When the phone was ringing... she was always the first to answer... and she shouted... For me, it was quite impossible to have a speech normally speaking!</p>\n<p>I knew she lived with her mother who was hard of hearing... One day, I said: \"it will be great if you could speak less strong at the phone...\" She agreed... but she forgot often... I had to remind her of: \"Do you mind speaking gently!\"</p>\n<p>Now, I am retired and these are old memories... but she still shouts with other younger colleagues!</p>\n<h3>Taras</h3>\n<p>Once I was forced to work with a person who really winded me up. On the first day of my work I asked him where the box is. And instead of  just saying where it is he started to call the box and say swear words. He abused me and after it I decided that it is better just to avoid him or try to have less conversation with him. And I want to say that it's really working. But it isn't always a right way. I had opportunities to avoid the difficult person but there are kind of jobs where you don't have such opportunities. So we should to search alternative ways to get on with our workmates.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>I don't know whether I am a very lucky person or a too tolerant one, but I must confess that I have never had any colleagues winding me up. Generally, if you are too tolerant, your colleagues take advantage of you. But fortunately my colleagues are very polite and I don't have to do any effort to get on with them. Obviously, the office is quite noisy sometime due to ringing telephones, arguing people, photocopiers and things like that, but if you think that every working day comes to an end, you will be able to put up with anything. Or almost.</p>\n<h3>Eşref, Turkey</h3>\n<p>I’m working in an open-plan office where we are 17 people work together. It is impossible not to be a colleage who wind up you. One of them really behave badly and irritate me. He wants to answer the phone firstly, and speaks loudly. Shortly everyone is being annoyed his behaviour. So firstly I warned him off his behaviours and loudly speech. For a short time he tries to come calm, but later returns his natural situation. At the end he didn’t change their behaviour, but I used to him.</p>\n<h3>Regiane</h3>\n<p>I work with someone with a really bad behaviour. This person could never mind using his extension to call someone (from another room) to asks something...He needs to shout, thus everybody knows what he wants. This guy does not mind using a couple of words like \"excuse me\" before entering in the others conversation. He talks so loud on the phone that disturbes everybody in the office.</p>\n<p>I am really thankful that we do not have an open-plan office, because it could be worst. Our office is so calm and peacefull when he is out... Eventually, all we need to do is to keep calm and learn how to deal with these colleagues, because does not matter where you go, they will be there.</p>\n<h3>Cristina, Spain</h3>\n<p>Once, I was working in a pub as a waitress and I had to deal with a pessimist-old-woman who works alongside me three days a week (the rest of the week I worked with a fabulous colleague). Her behavior really winds me up! She was all the time telling me stories about their family, which were irrelevant and inane. Moreover she made me sad, because she didn’t like working in a pub, so she criticized the costumers all the time, like: \"Children are all the time messing all up! They are so cheeky!\" Additionally, she was really clumsy, she used to break plates, and then she blamed me! I couldn't believe it. I tried to ignore her, but it was very hard.</p>\n<h3>Henry</h3>\n<p>It was a nightmare to work with a bitchy colleague. I once had a colleague who kept talking about her boyfriend. However, what she wanted was the colleagues' agreement with her. She would be in fury whenever we gave comments to what she said.</p>\n<p>She was ruled to colleagues but well-behaved in front of her supervisors. That is why I disagreed what my other colleagues said that she was just emotional. She actually knew how to behave, she just fired on us.</p>\n<p>Luckily, eventually I left that office and I don't need to work together with her anymore.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>I might tell you that in my current job, I have co-workers that always make irrelevant conversations by whatsApp or Facebook while we work. I think that this behavior is disruptive for our company. Our productivity have bad results when we waste the time. for this reason some companies began to prohibit this devices during working hours.</p>\n<h3>Manuel, Spain</h3>\n<p>I'm completely sure everyone has lived, worked or married a hell colleague.</p>\n<p>I'm a very active person, always trying to improve our working place and reducing risks. Lazyness is the worst behaviour to deal with. I think on my office as a common ground where develop the projects the managers set on us to guarantee our future and improve salaries</p>\n<h3>Peter</h3>\n<p>There is no alternative for me to live with my co worker. She is really talkative and incooperative. She is older than me 5 years old. When I was a new comer she has alredy worked for the company for 5 years. She always want to leave the office early for picking up her baby in the kindergarten so. But she always get away with leaving office early because she is a niece of our Deputy Executive officer. Sometimes I feel stressed because she is really lazy. All of work has been solved by me, she always talk about some inane topic. But I have to collaborate with her because my job is good.</p>\n<h3>Erika</h3>\n<p>When I was working back in Brazil I used to work in open-plan office, it was really hard because most of my colleagues were non sense . Many of them used to speak so loud and others used to eat smelly food in their office desk.</p>\n<p>One day I was talking with a client on the phone and people around me were talking out loud about an inane subject, not related to work so I had to ask them very nicely to speak lower because it was interfering with my conversation with the client. I remember me saying: \"guys would you mind talking in a lower voice please?\" They got all surprised and understood my point of view and they all got back to work instantly, since that day I had no problems dealing with them and they respected me some much more.</p>\n<h3>Juan Manuel, Spain</h3>\n<p>This really is a tricky issue for almost everybody.Wherever we go we may find people who don't agree with us: different behaviors, different feelings,different points of view. I think we all have sometimes had that sort of experiences. It seems we people are this way,each one different to the other, and sometimes we coincide and have similar feelings and other times we don't.<br>I have had hard arguments around work colleagues. Maybe the best way managing this situations is to accept them. Elsewhere we can find people who disturb us, even though ourselves can be disturbing too. It's necessary each one to find the best response to that fact. It could be a good beginning being friendly, assertive and giving explanations.</br></p>\n<h3>Francois</h3>\n<p>I worked 40 years and I haven't had many colleagues whose the behaviour was really bad. I remember that once I had a colleague who didn't smell good. As I was his manager, I had to deal with that. At first, I didn't know how to do. Then I decided to have a word with him and explain what could be the consequences for his colleagues. He was clever enough to figure out what I wanted to tell him and he changed his behaviour in the next days. Hadn't he been so smart, would I have managed to solve that problem? I wonder.</p>\n<h3>Manoel Gomes, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I think that most of us have to put up a colleague that winds us up. It's a very bad situation when someone affects your work. For example: if someone smokes in the office, my eyes start hurting and I try show him that his behavior is disruptive. In a polite way,  I ask if he would mind smoking outside the office. I advice him that smoking is too bad to health. </p>\n<h3>Daniela, Italy </h3>\n<p>Working with people isn't simple as you can imagine when you go to school.</p>\n<p>In my office, for example, there were an open space and people shared everything. They discussed a lot about football on Monday morning and that got me down and annoyed. I couldn't do my work. It was necessary silence to write articles and to answer to the email and it wasn't possible in this disrupted environment!</p>\n<p>Every day I fought aginst collegue that used to talk aloud about everything he did. If  you are writing something important for your boss, you must be concentrated and his behaviour was very annoying. I put up with this fact but, gradually, I started to deal with him explain my inconvenience. I convinced him that the better way to work together was the respect of own spaces and his behaviour changed soon. Eventually, I was satisfied and I had success thanks to hard work and determination.</p>\n<h3>Nguyễn Đăng Hà </h3>\n<p>In some situations, we have to work with tricky people. It is quite uncomfortable. Some people choose to avoid talking with people that they do not like. However, in my opinion, sharing experience about the task you are doing with your collaborators can improve that task. I believe that people bahave badly because we have not understood them. Therefore, I think we should talk more to them and be firm. We can ask them more about their family or friends if possible. In my experience, some people are hard to make friends, but that does not mean impossible.</p>\n<h3>Fabio</h3>\n<p>I’m so happy with my work. My colleagues are wonderful and friendlies. However, sometimes, some of them would like being myself. It’s very interesting e funny. All the things I make are copied by them. I dont complaint about that. I like that! and this is what they dont understand. I love them! I work with them! I'm your inspirations and i like of that!</p>\n<h3>Manuel</h3>\n<p>I´m actually have a co worker (a girl) that make her everyday work like an history, she always talk loudly with another co workers, on the phone conversations and sometimes use bad language.  I did a complaint directly in a good way, but the things gone worst, she answered me with screams and bad words. I don´t have another way to have a solution for this problem, I just have to be patient and count to ten and breath.</p>\n<h3>Aqidatul</h3>\n<p>Fortunately I never really had bad experience with annoying colleague. But sometimes there are few people who had bad odor and not maintaining their personal hygiene. It was quitie irritating for me. Another thing is the laziness of a few co-workers. When we were trying to be dilligent but the same thing not happen with your colleague than it won't work either. Especially if it is a team work oriented and in workplace we seldom work alone. So maintaining a good communication with your colleague is a must.</p>\n<h3>Florent, France</h3>\n<p>I used to work with a colleague in my old company who always did my daily job instead of executing his own activities. He used to come in my office, trying to get all information on projects I was responsible for, to stand personal benefits. He often abused and irritated me because I did not get the same knowledge as him. He did not use or share any of my ideas. I tried to be friendly and maintain my professional dignity but it is very difficult to work in such conditions when a colleague does not want to change his behaviour and collaborate further.</p>\n<p>Due to his age and seniority, he had a huge draw in the company and I could not air my grievances to my boss. So, I decided to change work to meet new people. Maybe I will have to collaborate with some same disruptive colleagues but for the time being, I am ready to keep smiling and make more effort to deal with such behaviour.</p>\n<h3>Monize, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Being a doctor is not easy, and this is my job. Everyday I listen to many problems, sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it's not. So, I work with every type of person. Some patients are very difficult people and some colleagues too. They do annoying things, like be rude, not having good hygiene and being silly. They need to known that their behaviour is not productive and sometimes it causes many problems, for example: poor service, low productivity and efficiency. In health services this can cost lives. Unfortunately, in Brazil, this is a very common scenario. Being polite and aware of the benefits of good communication and social interaction makes the working environment to be more dynamic, productive, efficient and happy. No one is equal to anyone but the smooth progress of work depends on the tolerance that everyone has with their co-workers.</p>\n<h3>Antonio</h3>\n<p>I remember a colleague that I had many years ago in another Company, not the Company I’m actually working.</p>\n<p>This person had a problem, he was an alcoholic. Many days on a week, he comes drunk to the job. The work consisted in to answer phone calls from clients that had problems with their internet connection. So, as you can suppose, to be drunk is not the better way to answer a phone call. He shouted the clients, bothered female colleagues and made too much noise.</p>\n<p>It was sadly, because really this man had problems in his house. He was in a divorce process and who knows what more.  I remember most of the days the boss told him to walk around the building for pass the hang over. One day, the company fired him.</p>\n<p>This story maybe could help us about the problems that have the people around us. Normally, we haven’t seen the problems of others, we think that we are the center of the world.</p>\n<h3>Ília </h3>\n<p>I can remenber the last tricky colleague I have because it's not usual and because it's recent.<br/> I've started working in a new company in a new project and the only person working on that is my colleague that was supposed to support me in the initial phase but instead of that fakes supporting me. Do you know when somebody says something verbally and his or her body language says the opposite? If you need help if you have any doubt ask me and when I do it I hear if you had took notes you wouldn't ask me that and so on. I'm new in the company and cannot air my grievances to my boss or anybody else. For the time being she gets away with faking real support because she is older on the project and has the project's leaders trust. I have no alternative to put up with trying to have support from others that are really available and ignoring her. No matters what happens my dignity is above everything.</p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>At work, there are always colleagues who try to distract others with bad jokes, inane conversations, or even things which have no signification, and I mean not at all. Sometimes, it is really difficult to work with these kind of colleagues, but I notice that they are often very appreciated by others, what do make the problem much more complicated. And, if they are so appreciated on the other hand, it's because sometimes we need to get distracted and come back to our day-to-day tasks much better, so anyway, I think we need this type of persons. Perhaps, if we deal with them and we play along with these 'colleagues from hell', the problem will be surprisingly resolved more effectively.</p>\n<h3>Pawan, Nepal</h3>\n<p>I have had few colleagues who made things very difficult for me; they used to chat inane and irrelevant subject matter right under my nose and had disruptive personality. If i try to air my grievances to my manager, he would discard it completely saying they were seniors and ought to be respected. So, my gripes would go unheard every time i try to. Its not that i haven't tried to collaborate with them - i have tried several times. But, they don't seem affable enough. This made me very upset but i had no other alternatives than to tolerate them at work.</p>\n<h3>Oni</h3>\n<p>I have an interesting story about a tricky co-worker. At that time, I got a new job and it means I have new co-workers. In the first day, I came to the new office. There are five people in my open-plan office. I introduced myself and also they introduced their selves to me. I felt uncomfortable when all of us were doing our own job. I heard a noisy sound and it really disturbed me. And the noisy sound came from my collaborating partner because he pushed keyboard buttons too firmly and too quickly, so it was like a piano concert but had disturbing sound and inconsistent rhythm. I could not do anything at that time. However, because it always disturbed me every day, and I couldn’t focus on my job. I decided to tell him what he did annoyed me. However, I thought what way I had to do because if I told him, probably it would hurt him. Finally, I got a brilliant idea. I said to him that pushing keyboard button too firmly and  too quickly could break the laptop. And I explained what the downsides were when laptop was broken. After long explanation, he understood it and he never do that again. In the end, both of us got advantage, I helped him to be avoided at breaking his laptop and I also felt better in my office.</p>\n<h3>Antonella, Bari, Italy</h3>\n<p>I have worked for three months at the University of Salerno in a chemical laboratory.  I had to join a team and I remember one of my colleague was what I can define a tricky one. She distracted me every 5 minutes with inane conversations and she ate on the only table in the laboratory, making it very tidy. Moreover, she brought her unauthorized friends in the lab, they touched every reagent and every flask that were there, so I couldn't get on with my scientific project. In the beginning, I complained with my boss, which suggested to me to talk about these problems with her. So I followed her advice and surprisingly  it worked. If I had talked to her at the beginning, I would not have any problems and I would finish my project earlier.</p>\n<h3>Mohammad Al Afifi, Palestine</h3>\n<p>I used to have a tricky colleagues, he is very quiet and concentrate when he is doing his work , but when I am working and he is free he always interrupt me and talk about irrelevant and boring subjects.</p>\n<p>I tried to be cool and patience for long time, but after a while his behavior affected my work quality and made me nervous, and at this point I decided to en this problem, I spoke to him and explain the problem and told him to stop this behavior politely.</p>\n<p>At the end I discovered that his behavior is just a bad habit, and when he realize that he stopped it and our relation became better.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session and all those tricky colleagues!

I’m Neil…</br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And I’m Finn. In this programme we’re looking at three prefixes: <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>, <strong>dys-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-y-s </strong>and <strong>dis-</strong>,spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Prefixes – or prefixes, as some people say - are two or three letters that go at the beginning of a word and affect its meaning.  </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We’ll look at what each prefix means and give you example sentences…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There’ll be a quiz …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But first, let’s listen to Gladys talking about her husband Bert.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: Does Gladys agree with Bert’s doctor?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Gladys<br/></span></strong><span>Bert’s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It’s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. The doctor says it’s because he eats too much fatty food. She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. No <strong>disrespect </strong>to the doctor, but I <strong>disagree</strong> - I think it’s caused by stress. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>So we asked you: Does Gladys agree with the doctor?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: No, she <strong>disagrees. </strong>Gladys thinks her husband’s indigestion is caused by stress, but the doctor thinks it’s due to a bad diet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Disagree</strong> is the key word because it has the prefix <strong>dis</strong>, spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>. This means not. So by adding <strong>dis,</strong> we can turn a word into its opposite. So <strong>dis - agree</strong> means not to agree …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>…and <strong>dis - respect</strong> means not having respect.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Gladys says <strong>No disrespect to the doctor </strong>– meaning she doesn’t want people to think she doesn’t respect what the doctor says<strong>.</strong> Let’s hear another clip from Gladys with more prefixes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span>Bert’s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It’s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>discomfort. </strong>If you know what the word <strong>comfort</strong> means…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… then you can work out what <strong>discomfort </strong>means: <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>comfort</strong>  give us the opposite of comfort: Bert’s feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And in the clip, we heard the word <strong>dyspepsia</strong> – that’s the medical word for indigestion, when your stomach feels very full and uncomfortable after you eat.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>This word starts with the prefix <strong>dys</strong>, but this time it’s spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>This prefix is less common than <strong>dis</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>, but it also has a negative meaning – it has the idea of being bad or abnormal.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>dyspepsia </strong>is a medical condition when your body can’t process food in the normal way.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Other words with the prefix <strong>dys-</strong> , spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>, are <strong>dyslexia </strong>and <strong>dysfunctional. </strong>People who have <strong>dyslexia</strong> have difficulty with reading…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… and if something is <strong>dysfunctional</strong>, it doesn’t work properly.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have another clip with the prefix <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>d-i-s</strong>. We’ll also hear our next prefix.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span></strong><span>She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>disappear</strong> - that’s <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>appear</strong>…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and <strong>disappear</strong>, means the opposite of <strong>appear.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We also had the word <strong>detox</strong>, which starts with the prefix <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the prefix <strong>de-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-e</strong>, usually means take away or remove something …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, if something is described as a <strong>detox</strong>, <strong>de-tox</strong>, it means it takes away toxins or poisons. A <strong>detox</strong> diet could be one with just fruit and vegetables.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I like to <strong>detox</strong> at the end of the day with a hot bath.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>           <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And we’re talking about the prefixes<strong> dis-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>;<strong> dys</strong>,spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>; and<strong> de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>All these prefixes have a negative meaning.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And now it’s quiz time. Choose the correct word. Number one: One minute the dogs were playing in the garden. The next minute the garden was empty and they’d all a) disagreed b) disappeared c) detoxed.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the answer to that is b) <strong>disappeared</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Number two. People who drink too much alcohol sometimes go to a clinic for a a) dyspepsia b) discomfort c) detox.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>The answer is c) <strong>detox</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And number three: My daughter is having problems learning to read. Her teacher thinks she may be a) disrespectful b) dyslexic c) dysfunctional.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>The answer is b) <strong>dyslexic</strong>. And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, well done. And now, here’s our top tip for learning vocabulary: when you see or hear a new word, see if you can break the word up - if it starts with a prefix that you recognise, it may help you to understand the meaning.  </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>There’s more about this at </span><a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\"><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>.

Adding <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>dys-</strong> or <strong>de-</strong> makes the new word have a negative meaning. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Let's look in a little more detail.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Dis-</strong> usually gives the opposite meaning. So, to <strong>disagree</strong> is the opposite of <strong>agree</strong>. <strong>Disappear</strong> is the opposite of <strong>appear</strong>. And if you know what <strong>comfort</strong> means, then you can guess what <strong>discomfort</strong> means!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Words beginning with <strong>dys-</strong> are usually medical. They're quite technical, but if your doctor says you have <strong>dyskinesia</strong> (difficulty moving normally), <strong>dysphagia</strong> (difficulty swallowing) or <strong>dyssomnia</strong> (difficulty sleeping), then you know you're not completely healthy.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>De-</strong> often has the idea of moving 'away' from something. Or, like <strong>dis-</strong>, it can also give an opposite meaning. To <strong>decentralise</strong> is to move things away from the centre (the opposite of <strong>centralise</strong>). If you <strong>deforest</strong> land, you take the trees away. And to <strong>detox</strong> is to remove toxins (harmful substances).</span></span></p>\n<p>Understanding how prefixes affect meaning is a very useful tool. Next time you see a word you don't know, have a look to see if it's made of a prefix and a word you do know. If you know the prefix, there's a good chance you guess the new word too.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>We're going to do two activities. In the first one, we'll focus on words with the three prefixes from this unit's 6 Minute Grammar. After that, we'll do one when you try to guess the meanings of difficult words. Let's begin.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next up we're going to do another activity where we bring in a few more prefixes: <strong>re-</strong>, <strong>pre-</strong>, <strong>pro-</strong>, <strong>in-</strong>, <strong>un-</strong> and <strong>mis-</strong>. How well do you know them?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Re-, pre-, pro-, in-, un-, mis-</h3>\n<p>There are lots of prefixes to learn in English. In our pre-intermediate course we looked at six more: <strong>re-</strong>, <strong>pre-</strong>, and <strong>pro-</strong> in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-24/session-1/activity-3%20\">Unit 24</a>, and <strong>un-</strong>, <strong>in-</strong> and <strong>mis-</strong> back in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-3/session-1/activity-4\">Unit 3</a>.</p>\n<p>First, let's <strong>revise</strong> the meanings of these prefixes! Later, we'll do a test.</p>\n<p><strong>1) re = again</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>reheat (heat again), reuse (use again), replay (play again), revise (look at again)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) pre = before, already</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>precooked (cooked already), prepacked (packed already), prewar (before a war)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) pro = in support of, in favour of (often followed by a hyphen)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>proactive (in favour of being active), pro-British (in favour of Britain), pro-capitalist (in favour of capitalism)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) un = not</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>unclean (not clean), unhygienic (not hygienic), unhappy (not happy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5) in = not</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>incomplete (not complete), intolerant (not tolerant), inaccurate (not accurate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6) mis = wrong, or not</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>mishear (to hear incorrectly), misunderstanding (a situation when people understand each other wrongly), mislead (to make someone believe the wrong thing)</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p><span><span>It's time to see if you can build some more vocabulary. <strong>Revision</strong> is important before an exam, as we know. Let's read about a young man called Richard as he revises for his exams. Can you fill in the gaps in the story with the correct words, even if you haven't seen them before?</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Well done. We hope that next time you see a word starting with one of these prefixes you'll feel a bit more confident, not unconfident! In Session 2 we're looking at modals of speculation and deduction, things like <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> and <strong>could</strong>...</p></div>",

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me Catherine. In today's programme we're having a look at modal verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now modal verbs are used in a lot of different ways but in this programme we’re looking at the modal verbs we use when we're talking about things we think are possible or true – both in the present and in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. When we don't know something for sure, we often make guesses. And modal verbs can express how sure or unsure we are about our guesses. We'll give you lots of examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we’ll check what you've learned in our quiz.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But first, we're listening to Fiona, who is a science reporter. And Fiona is talking about some ancient fossils that were found in China and Taiwan.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Are the fossils from humans?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Fiona<br/></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan <strong>could be looking</strong> at something very important. It seems that the fossils <strong>can't be</strong> from any known human species. They <strong>might be</strong> the result of breeding between species or they <strong>may belong</strong> to an unknown human species. The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups <strong>may have lived</strong> there than previously thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So that was Fiona. And we asked you: Are the fossils from humans?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: Maybe. They <strong>might be</strong> the result of breeding between species or they <strong>may belong</strong> to an unknown human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we don't know the answer for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. Now the modal verbs <strong>might</strong> and <strong>may </strong>plus an infinitive show that we're talking about a present possibility, not a certainty. The modal verb <strong>could</strong> does this too, either with an infinitive or with a continuous form. Here's an example.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan <strong>could be looking</strong> at something very important…</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>In fact, we can say <strong>could be looking, might be looking</strong> or <strong>may be looking</strong> there.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right: it's a modal verb plus the continuous form of <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>verb–ing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But what about this sentence? Listen.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong>It seems that the fossils <strong>can't be</strong> from any known human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Fiona uses the modal <strong>can’t </strong>there. Now we use <strong>can't </strong>with an infinitive when we believe strongly that something isn't possible. The researchers believe strongly that the fossils don't belong to any known human species. They <strong>can't</strong> come from a known human species – it's not possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So they <strong>must be</strong> from an unknown human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. <strong>Must </strong>or<strong> can't </strong>plus an infinitive both help us to express a strong belief that something is or isn't possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>When we're less sure about something, we can say, for example, the fossils <strong>might not, mightn’t </strong>or<strong> may not be</strong> from a known human species.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, but don’t use the negative <strong>couldn't</strong> like this. It's different. <strong>Couldn't</strong> plus an infinitive means that something is completely impossible. Right then. Now let's look at possibilities and certainties in the past. Here's the next clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong>The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups <strong>may have lived</strong> there than previously thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we can also use <strong>might, may, could, can't</strong> and <strong>must</strong> with <strong>have</strong> and the past participle of the verb when we think something was possible in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, we can say <strong>may have lived, might have lived </strong>or<strong> could have lived</strong> to express past possibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we use<strong> can't </strong>or <strong>must </strong>with <strong>have</strong> and the past participle when we're <strong>certain</strong> about something in the past. For example, <strong>t</strong><strong>he scientists can't have expected to find anything so important</strong>.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. <strong>They must have been very excited</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I'm sure they were!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           <br/>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we're talking about modal verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's quiz time! For each of these sentences, choose <strong>might</strong>,<strong> must</strong> or <strong>can’t</strong> to fill the gap: Number one: Finn, you got an A grade in physics? Wow. You _____ have studied really hard.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>must</strong>. You must have studied really hard. I did Catherine.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Very good, Finn! Number two: Nick just called. He is stuck in traffic: he _____ be late.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>And this one is <strong>might</strong>. <strong>He might be late</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done! Number three: You _____ have seen a ghost. There's no such thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>can't.</strong> <strong>You can’t have seen a ghost. </strong>There's no such thing. Is there Catherine?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I don't think so, Finn. What about you?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We don’t believe in ghosts. And that's the end of the quiz.

Mars is a dead planet, isn’t it? There <strong>must</strong> <strong>be</strong> another explanation.\"</p>\n<p>Mo replied: \"Well their information <strong>might not be</strong> completely accurate.

The room is empty except for a bed and a shelf. The room has no window, and only one door, which is locked. The room is in a house far away from others, but is close to a railway line.</p>\n<p>How did they die?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The answer</h3>\n<p>Don't read this if you're not ready! This is a well-known riddle and the answer usually given is... Romeo and Juliet are fish! They were in a glass bowl on the shelf, but this shook and fell when a train went past. It smashed on the floor and Romeo and Juliet died.</p>\n<p>But maybe you could think of another way they died?</p>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now it's time for 6 Minute Grammar. Finn and Catherine take a trip round the world of modal verbs.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Modals of deduction and speculation</h3>\n<p>Do you know what to say when you're making a guess about a past or present situation?

In 2011, researchers working on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya took a wrong turn and <strong>spotted</strong> sharp flakes of stone removed from larger rocks.

I'm Catherine...</br></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And I'm Neil. Today we're looking at the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>less </strong>and<strong> -</strong><strong>free.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word that affect its meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll look at what the suffixes <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-less</strong> mean and give you some examples...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There'll be a quiz...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's start by listening to Markus. He's a politician and he's talking about his party's policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right. So while you listen, think about this question: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke? Here's Markus.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves. We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones. We're going to extend the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes, which may be <strong>smokeless</strong>, but they aren't <strong>harmless</strong>, and we're going to raise the penalties for <strong>careless</strong> drivers.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> So we asked you: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And the answer is: No they don't. E-cigarettes are <strong>smokeless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And<strong> smokeless </strong>is a key word in this programme because it ends with the suffix<strong> less, </strong>spelt<strong> l-e-s-s. </strong>This means 'without'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So <strong>smokeless</strong> cigarettes are cigarettes without smoke - they don't produce any smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if something is <strong>harmless</strong>, it doesn't cause harm. Markus said that e-cigarettes are not <strong>harmless</strong>. In other words, they are dangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Markus also said his party was going to raise penalties - or increase punishments - for <strong>careless </strong>drivers - people who drive without care.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>careless </strong>means not being careful. </p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, by adding <strong>-less</strong> to the nouns <strong>smoke, harm </strong>and<strong> care,</strong> we turn them into adjectives. Let's hear some more examples with <strong>-less</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we had the <strong>jobless</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's people without jobs...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...the <strong>homeless</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...people who have nowhere to live. We can create a noun to describe a particular group of people, by using the word <strong>the</strong> with a <strong>­-less</strong> word. <strong>The jobless</strong>, <strong>the homeless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Lastly, we had the adjective<strong> powerless, </strong>which describes people who are unable to do certain things. If we add <strong>the</strong>, we get a group noun: <strong>the powerless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's have another clip. Listen out for the suffix <strong>-free.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We had <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong>. Now if you add <strong>-free</strong> to a noun, you get an adjective, meaning that there isn't any of that noun, or it's not allowed, or both. <strong>Car-free </strong>means there are no cars because they're not allowed. <strong>Smoke-free</strong> means smoking is not allowed and so there is no smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>free </strong>and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong>. And Neil how was your journey to work today; <strong>stress-free</strong>, I hope?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, actually, it was awful! I tried to use my <strong>contactless </strong>credit card to pay for the train, but it didn't work, so I had to walk all the way...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, won't do you any harm, Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. It's good for me, I suppose.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It is. And <strong>contactless</strong> credit cards are the cards that work without a PIN number.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Usually you use either <strong>-</strong><strong>free</strong> or <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> with a particular word. But occasionally you can use <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> interchangeably, as in <strong>sugarless</strong> and <strong>sugar-free. </strong>These both mean: without sugar.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But be very careful with the words <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree </strong>because they have very different meanings.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they do. A<strong> careless </strong>person is someone who doesn't take much care over what they're doing...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...whereas a<strong> carefree </strong>person like you, Neil, doesn't worry about anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I don't worry about a thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one: Jack looks scary, but he's actually very kind and gentle. He's a) careless b) harmless c) powerless.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>harmless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number two. Dalya doesn't check her work properly so she makes lots of mistakes. She's very a) careless  b) carefree  c) contactless.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> careless</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: To cut the risk of cancer, some people smoke e-cigarettes which are a) smokeless b) smokeless-free c) smoke-free.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>smokeless.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: record yourself saying new words and then listen to them every day. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Top tip.

Of course, it's possible to be both at once!</p>\n<p>In this activity, we're going to test your knowledge of the words that have these suffixes. Sometimes a word can have either <strong>-free</strong> or <strong>-less</strong>, but be careful because this can change the meaning, as in <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree</strong>.</p>\n<p>One hint to help you is that for places where something is not allowed, we usually use <strong>-free</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Choose the correct words to complete these sentences.

Was that a <strong>stress-free</strong> experience, or did you make some <strong>careless</strong> mistakes? Next we're going to revise a few more suffixes:</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Revise -ee, -able, -ible, -ness, and job suffixes</h3>\n<p>Learning what prefixes and suffixes mean can really help you improve your vocabulary. We revised prefixes in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-6/session-1/activity-3\">Unit 6</a> of this course. Now we're going to help you feel more confident with suffixes too.</p>\n<p>We've already taught some prefixes in our Lower Intermediate course. For example, in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-1/session-1/activity-3%20\">Unit 1</a> we looked at:</p>\n<p><strong>1) ee = </strong>creates a noun meaning 'person who receives an action'</p>\n<ul>\n<li>employee, interviewee, trainee</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) able = </strong>creates an adjective meaning that the subject can do something OR that something can be done to it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>excitable, loveable, breakable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) ible = </strong>a different spelling of<strong> -able</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>responsible, visible, terrible</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) ness = </strong>creates a noun which describes a quality or state</p>\n<ul>\n<li>happiness, politeness, kindness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-10/session-1/activity-3%20\">Unit 10 </a>of our Lower Intermediate course, we looked at <strong>job suffixes</strong> - things you add to words to make them job titles.</p>\n<p><span><strong>5) job titles ending in –er</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>presenter, teacher, train driver</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>6) job titles ending in –or</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>actor (some people say actress for female actors), translator</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>7) job titles ending in –ian</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>librarian, politician, optician</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>8) job titles ending in –ist</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>journalist, receptionist, dentist</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>A loveable but excitable dog. A breakable vase. It sounds like it will end badly! Can you fill in the gaps in the story with the correct words, even if you haven't seen them before?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>Well done. We hope learning suffixes has filled you heart with <strong>happiness</strong>. Or at least made you feel they're not so <strong>terrible</strong>!

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br/></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Today we're talking about the past perfect tense.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Yes, the past perfect. When we want to talk about two things that happened at different times in the past, we can use the past perfect tense - that's a subject with <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>. And here's Harry with our first example:</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And let's hear that again.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Thanks Harry. Now we could put these two events in the past simple tense, something like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And once again Harry.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Or, we can change the order of events in the sentence, and use the past perfect - that's <strong>had </strong>with a <strong>past participle</strong> - to show which event actually happened first.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>And here, the past perfect in <strong>John had gone</strong> shows that this happened before the past simple phrase <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell</strong>. So we have: <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Exactly. Now, let's look at some more examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Let's hear that again.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>So we've got two past events. First, Harry lost Jim's number; then he got his text. But in Harry's sentence, the event that happened first in time is mentioned second in the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob   <br/></strong>So he uses the past perfect - <strong>I'd lost his number</strong> - to show that the second event he mentions, actually happened first.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Now in spoken English, the past perfect can sometimes be difficult to hear. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Yes that's true - in our example just now, the two words <strong>I had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I'd</strong>. I'd lost his number. </p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a /d/ sound. Listen out for the short /d/ sound in this next example: </p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And again.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Did you catch that?</p>\n<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>First, Mrs Brown washed her phone in the washing machine. Then she opened the washing machine. Then she realised... She'd washed her phone!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and the phrase <strong>she had washed</strong> is shortened to <strong>she'd washed</strong>. One more time please Harry.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Oops - that's an expensive mistake. Poor Mrs Brown!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Yeah, she won't do that again!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT        <br/></strong>6 Minute Grammar from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now for a quiz. I'm going to say some sentences and, as you listen, try to decide what happened first, and what happened second. Here's the first one. <strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>OK, so the past perfect here is <strong>I'd forgotten</strong>, and the order of events was: first, I forgot to set the alarm, and second, I woke up late. Here it is again. </p>\n<p><strong>Harry          <br/></strong><strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Great. Another one: <strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>How embarrassing. OK, and we've got the negative of had, which is <strong>hadn't</strong>. So first, I didn't bring a towel, and second, I couldn't have a shower. Here it is again. </p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Good. And for the last one: <strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Rob   <br/></strong>This one has three events: first, they left the tickets at home. Second, they got to the station. And third, they realised that the tickets were at home.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine   <br/></strong>Yes and the past perfect phrase <strong>they had left</strong>, was shortened to <strong>they'd left</strong> - which helps us show that order.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob</strong>   <br/>Now, a mistake people sometimes make with the past perfect is: they use it too much, or they use it just because they are talking about something that happened a long time ago. Such as...</p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>Jackie had gone to a football match last month.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>Yes - there's only one past event here, so we probably just need the past simple tense:</p>\n<p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>Jackie went to a football match last month.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rob   <br/></strong>So that's the past perfect. It's made of <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong> and we mainly use it to talk about a past event that happened before another past event.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>   <br/>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Two events in the past...</h3>\n<p>In this unit we're looking at the past perfect tense. We use it when two actions or events in a sentence happened in the past, and we need to show which one happened first. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived home, my son had baked an enormous carrot cake.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this sentence, the son baked the cake first, then the parent arrived home. Did you notice how the grammar worked? Well, we're going to explore that at the bottom of this page, but first, we'd like to see how much you know already - or can work out for yourself.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First let's read this story about a woman called Roberta. She's had a terrible day. We'll look at how the past perfect works, and then we'll do an exercise to test your understanding of the past perfect tense.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>I had a terrible day today. It started badly and just got worse.</p>\n<p>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set my alarm clock. Because I was late, I ran to the train station but when I got there I realised I hadn't brought my <strong>season ticket</strong>. I missed my train.</p>\n<p>By the time I arrived at work, the staff meeting had already started. I really wanted to finish work at the usual time of 5pm because I wanted to see my favourite band at a concert. But I couldn’t leave on time because I hadn’t completed the report my boss had asked for.</p>\n<p>I left work late - and by the time I arrived at the concert <strong>venue</strong>, the band had already finished playing. I <strong>wept</strong> like a child.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Past perfect tense: Meaning and use</h3>\n<p><strong>What happened first:</strong> my son made a cake</p>\n<p><strong>What happened second:</strong> I arrived</p>\n<p>We use the <strong>past perfect part </strong>of the sentence to show which event happened first (and often the past simple to say what happened second):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived home, my son had already made an enormous carrot cake.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also change the order of events in the sentence, and still show what happened first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>My son had made an enormous carrot cake when I arrived home.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Form</h3>\n<p>The past perfect is made with <strong>subject +</strong> <strong>had/hadn’t +</strong> <strong>past</strong> <strong>participle</strong>. <br/><br/><strong>Positive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When my parents got to the station, they realised <strong>they had left</strong> the tickets at home. </em></li>\n<li><em>By the time Mark arrived at work, <strong>the staff meeting had already started</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>I woke up late because <strong>I’d forgotten</strong> to set my alarm clock. </em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Kerry couldn’t leave work on time because <strong>she hadn't written </strong>the report.</em></li>\n<li><em>They didn’t tell the police about the accident <strong>they had seen</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Had you finished</em></strong><em> your homework before the movie started?</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Hadn't John told</strong> them what he wanted?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important note</strong></p>\n<p>The most common mistake with the past perfect is to overuse it, or to use it simply because we are talking about a time in the distant past. The past perfect sentence <em>The Romans <strong>had spoken</strong> Latin </em>would be better in the past simple: <em>The Romans <strong>spoke</strong> Latin.</em></p>\n<p>Remember that we only use the past perfect when we want to refer to a past that is earlier than another time in the narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra tip: time expressions</strong></p>\n<p>Quite often with the past perfect we use adverbs like <strong>already</strong> and <strong>just:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When I arrived home, my sister <strong>had already made</strong> lunch.</em></li>\n<li><em>I <strong>had just taken</strong> off my coat when the telephone rang.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use time expressions like <strong>when,</strong> <strong>before</strong> and<strong> by the time</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>When</strong> I arrived at the concert venue, the band <strong>had already finished</strong> playing.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Had you finished</strong> your meal <strong>before</strong> your friend arrived?</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>By the time</strong> we got to the party all the food had gone.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now that you've seen the tense in action, it's time to use your knowledge to complete another activity. It's time to test the form!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>The plane had already left...</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to test your knowledge of the past perfect form. As we said, we use the past perfect tense to show which past event happened first. The past event that happened second is usually in the past simple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By the time I got to the airport, the plane <strong>had already left</strong>.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the sentences.

The staff at Tip Top Trading – the leading manufacturer of imitation plastic fruit – are busy trying to meet a huge demand in orders for its new 'Awesome Apple' product. But there's a problem because some of the orders have not been <strong>awesome</strong>, or indeed apple…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[on the phone] Yeah, yeah calm down mate… what can I do about it? Apples, avocados, they're all the same really. <strong>I'm afraid there's nothing I could do about it</strong>. Hello… hello? He hung up on me!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Is there a problem Tom?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Oh that was old Slimey Limey – he says his order for ten thousand 'Awesome Apples' isn't right – he's received ten thousand 'Amazing Avocados' instead. I told him it's not my fault, I didn't send them out. Sorry Anna <strong>it's out of my hands now</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Well don't look at me – I haven't had anything to do with Mr Lime since… the incident.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>[mocking] 'Sorry, but it's out of my hands' – lazy Tom is trying to pass the blame. Why did you marry him Anna?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Because I… I… find him unusual. Anyway, it sounds like it's down to me to sort this out.<br/>[to the team]<br/>Look, I'm not blaming anyone – yet - but we have to sort this out. Slimey, I mean Mr Lime, is one of our biggest <strong>clients</strong>. Denise could you see if we have any more Awesome Apples in the warehouse that we can send him?</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>OK Anna – I'm onto it now.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>He sounded really angry – a bit like you when I used all the hot water in the bath this morning, Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Hmm, I haven't forgotten about that Tom.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Anna… according to our database, we're completely out of Awesome Apples – and Big Bananas and even Imperial Lemons. [panicking] What are we doing to do Anna?!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>What are you going to do Anna? It's time to do some <strong>grovelling</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Grovelling?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>To show lots of respect for him – to try to please him. Be apologetic and use phrases like…<br/><br/>I'm really sorry to let you down but…<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, but… and maybe…<br/>It's not how we planned it but…</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>But…?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>But… explain what the problem is and how are you going to fix things? It's over to you Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Anna, listen Anna… I can't ring Mr Lime and give him the bad news – I've got my… errr… <strong>reputation</strong> to think of.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Yes you've certainly got a reputation Tom!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Thank you Denise. Look, it's Tip Top Trading's reputation we've got to think about now. I'm going to have to ring him now…</p>\n<p>[dials phone]</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Sid Lime speaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Oh hello Mr Lime. It's Anna from Tip Top Trading here…</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Ah Anna, I did wonder when you would call. I see you're getting Tom to do all your <strong>dirty work</strong> now hmmm? I don't know why you ever married…</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>It's about the Awesome Apples… I'm really sorry about the mix up… someone obviously got their apples mixed up with their avocados…</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Obviously! So you'll be sending me a replacement <strong>ASAP</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Err… well that's thing… I'm really sorry to let you down but… but… we haven't got any more Awesome Apples in stock to send you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Oh no! Not so 'awesome'…</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Clearly it's not how we planned it but something has gone wrong – we normally <strong>pride ourselves</strong> on good customer service…</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>Clearly!</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Look, we're really sorry to disappoint you but we will be producing some more Awesome Apples in a few weeks' time and we will…. err… we will send you an extra 1,000 apples as <strong>compensation</strong>. How does that sound Mr Lime?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lime</strong><br/>[thinking it over] Hmmm, an extra 1,000 you say? OK then… and how about having dinner with me sometime as well Anna?</p>\n<p>[slams phone down]</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Well done Anna! She handled the call very well, sounding apologetic, honest and fair. Here are the phrases that helped her…<br/><br/><strong>I'm really sorry to let you down.</strong><br/><strong>Sorry to disappoint you but…</strong><br/><strong>It's not how we planned it but...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So come on then, how angry was he?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Not angry… everything is sorted, I think he'll be…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>[interrupting] Anna, I've just been looking through the paperwork from the warehouse and on the order for Slimey Limey somebody ticked 'avocados' and not 'apples'.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Let me have a look [paper rustle] ... oh, and look who signed the paperwork… Tom!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[lost for words] What?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Tom, you thought I was angry this morning – just wait until I get you home.</p>\n<p> </p> </div>",

If you want to become a pilot or a doctor, you can't just leave your current job and walk into a whole new profession.</p>\n<p>But that's not stopping people who want to make the change from one career to another.</p>\n<p>In this activity we get some tips on changing careers from former tennis player Boris Becker. Then we answer questions to see how much you've understood, and help you practise the past perfect.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Read the article and answer the questions.</p>\n<h3>Article</h3>\n<p><span><span>One of Boris Becker's most important victories wasn't even on the tennis court. Although he had <strong>excelled at</strong> the sport from a young age, it wasn't until he won a few competitions that his parents were convinced he was doing the right thing. \"In the mid-80s, professional sports weren't <strong>financially rewarding</strong>,\" he says.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But by the time he was 20 he had won two major <strong>titles</strong>, including being the youngest player to win Wimbledon in 1985 at the age of only 17. He was nicknamed \"Boom Boom\" thanks to his fast and aggressive style of play. He had won two more before the end of the decade, with a further two <strong>Grand Slam</strong> victories in the 1990s.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But of course at some point the tennis had to stop. And since then, Becker has become a successful businessman, with interests in <strong>real estate</strong>, finance, TV and coaching. How did he make the <strong>transition</strong>?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\"It was not easy,\" says Becker.  \"Fortunately I'd won a couple of <strong>tournaments</strong> so I didn't need to work the very next day. But I was still young and <strong>eager to</strong> get involved in areas I really cared for. I started a couple of companies and, 15 years later, I'd like to think I have a second career.\"</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>He had served as a tennis <strong>commentator</strong> with the BBC for over 10 years before <strong>taking up the role of</strong> coach to world number one Novak Djokovic in 2013. And in the summer of 2014, he guided the player to his second Wimbledon title.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But other career choices have had nothing to do with tennis. Becker is also a professional <strong>poker</strong> player. So what advice does he give people who are thinking about changing their working lives? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\"Read a lot, speak a lot to people that know more than you.\" And most importantly: \"Give yourself the time and think a lot about what you want to do with the rest of your life.\"</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\"Trust your <strong>instincts</strong>. Be surrounded by the right people. Be open-minded about it. Don't expect that every decision you make is going to be successful. Be <strong>gutsy</strong> about it.\"</span></span></p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>So that's Boris Becker's advice. But what about you? In the next activity, you get your chance to tell us about a career move you made.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Tell us about it!</h3>\n<p>You've read Boris Becker's views on changing career. But while his advice about being open-minded and listening to advice might be useful, most of us aren't already famous sportspeople with a lot of prize money in our bank accounts. But nonetheless, many people do change careers.</p>\n<p>So how do you move into a new <strong>line of work</strong> when you have no experience, and can't afford to just leave your job?</p>\n<p>Many choose to get a relevant qualification through an evening or weekend course. Others do take a period of <strong>unpaid leave</strong>, others <strong>volunteer</strong> or do an <strong>internship</strong>.</p>\n<p>With good<strong> contacts</strong> and some experience <strong>under your belt</strong>, some manage to <strong>move sideways</strong> into a new profession. For others, the only option is <strong>drop a grade</strong> or two. Whatever strategy you choose, good <strong>networking skills</strong> and plenty of <strong>conviction</strong> are essential!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's your chance to write a story of your own.

I've been an electronic engineer for more then eight years. But I was compelled to sit at home with my children because the crisis had happened. I've never thought that with such huge experience under my belt I need to move sideways. Nonetheless I volunteered for about three months since I hadn't excelled to find any paid job. Today I must work hard and be gutsy to convince an hypothetical employer of my capability.</p>\n<h3>Manuel, Cantabria, Spain</h3>\n<p>One of the worst aspects you job could have is the routine. You could feel tired and exhausted. Its very convenient you could change your job, you could keen on another activitie.</p>\n<p>I was working as a civil servant in an open office and I've been working since 1987 in a same job. But in 2008 I decided to improve my labour conditions and I began to work as a teacher in the secondary education. My career, that had been hard and quiet, has change definitely. The children, my students offer to me some enormous satisfactions. If I hadn't decide start a new job, I wouldn't have had the change to reach a new and grateful objectives.</p>\n<h3><strong>Rafael, Venezuela</strong></h3>\n<p>I'm an Industrial Engineer and all of my jobs have been related to the marketing field. Last year, I worked as an intern with Chrysler. I was chosen for a marketing position that I really wanted. It was all due to the fact that I'd worked previously as the marketing professor's assistant. It's very unusual for Industrial Engineers to work in this area because they usually prefer to work with manufacturing process. However, I'd seen my sister's experience in the marketing field and I felt as if I wanted to be a part of that world too. </p>\n<h3><strong>Manoel, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>I have worked since I was 18. I had worked as auto mechanic before I started to work as government employee, my current job. I think when I will be retired, it will be good if I start a new career. Maybe something like estate agent.</p>\n<h3>Peter</h3>\n<p>I had had a tough time when I quited my first job as a flight attendant. This job gave me a good salary compare to our country salary and at that time I didn't have any networking or contacts. I had to drop a grade. I had been a credit officer in a bank with unpaid leave before I worked as an accountant until now. At this moment, there are still a lot of challenges for my career but I think I chose a right road.</p>\n<h3>TJ Chen, Taiwan</h3>\n<p>I've started work since 2011, but I don't think it had any opportunities to be promoted or got a pay raise in my first company, so I decided to change my job and improve my English 2 years ago.</p>\n<p>I had studied English to take a exam, then I did a good grade for myself.</p>\n<p>After that, I completed my resume and applied some companies for a new job.</p>\n<p>I had got a few interviews, and entered a company I want.</p>\n<p>Now I still work for this job and learn English in many ways.</p>\n<h3>Yamelith</h3>\n<p>One day I was doing my regular job and I realized that I really needed a change in my life so that, I decided to sell my car and hand my notice.</p>\n<p>I had been working for a logistic company for four years as an Engineer and I did love my job but I wanted to live abroad and become more open-minded.</p>\n<p>Starting in a new Country is not easy but I've always thought that is much better to regret about the things you did instead of regretting about things you never did. Of course you need to be brave and determined to achieve your goals but it is worthy.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>Whether I like it or not, I will be forced to move into a new line of work because I have recently been made redundant. Before my compulsory redundancy, I had worked for more than 10 years in a company selling building material. Anyway, I am quite confident to add a new skill under my belt soon, as I am studying english very hard. I hope to take up a job involving my english language knowledge because I wouldn't like my effort to learn english to be wasted.</p>\n<h3>Jose Maria, Spain</h3>\n<p>I have considerable experience in changing career. To begin with, I had worked as a consultant for two years when I decided to take a period of unpaid leave and think about my professional future, because I was not enthusiastic about what I was doing.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am going in for a public competition in the Ministry of Treasury, so I have a long haul of hard study to achieve my aim. Before that, I had improved my command of English for six months through a highly regarded Academy, as well as an accounting course.</p>\n<p>So, I hope I will do what I really like in the prompt future. The experience has shown me that it is extremely essential to find the job which makes you happy, because you will be working most part of your life.</p>\n<h3>Antonio, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I am a civil servant since 2008, but before this I had worked for 30 years as a bank clerk. I was already retired when decided to do a test for the new job. Between the two events I'd tried a period as unpaid leave. But I hadn't money enough for this and then decided to make a test for a new job. This new job is quite financially rewarding.</p>\n<h3>Ewa, Poland</h3>\n<p>By the time I had worked as a employee I realised that I want work for myself. I had taken a period of unpaid leave and then I prepared myself to new line of work. I've had excellent skills of organisation and great eager to change my live therefore I was sure that I'll succeed. I've chosen the area of tourism because I live in town that is often visited by people from around the world. I knew I need to be gutsy and work very hard but I also knew that I would cope with it all.</p>\n<h3>Simret</h3>\n<p>Changing my career is one of the hardest thing that I’ve ever done in my life. I was a second year medical student when I decided that being a doctor is not the line of work I want to pursue. I hadn't studied hard, so I failed my exams.</p>\n<p>That is when I decided to move sideways and pursue my interest in technology. I’ve dropped out of medical school and joined a college to study computer science. What I like about this field is that it is always changing and there is always a new thing to learn.</p>\n<h3>Eleonora, Italy</h3>\n<p>Elena is my sister, she is 36 year-old and she was a shop assistant in a little ladieswear boutique. She was quite happy doing this job, but one day she met an association committed to wild animals protection, so she began as a volunteer to care of wounded animals and then when she realized that she was happy there. She left her job and started a new adventure, first as a volunteer and now she is working as clerk in administration, but it might be she will take a veterinarian degree and she’ll work as veterinarian there.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>My first work was in a beer factory, when I started there, I hadn't known the process to make beer. I learned much about this industry but I realized that my line of work in that job I didn't like more. For this reason, I started to study electronic engineering and now I'm working as support engineer in other company, and I think that I have the conviction and the instincts to make a good job there but I need to study english because I want to move in that job at a high level.</p>\n<h3>Anh Le</h3>\n<p>I graduated from high school when I was age 18. I had decided to learn sewing and worked as tailor since then. One day I realized that I wanted to change my life. I decided to take part the courses in English Center. Through the advice of friend, I took the examination entry to Scientific, Social and Humanity University in English. I had studied very hard and graduated from University in 2000. I had started to work as officer then. Although the current job doesn’t give more money than the others, I really love it. It makes me happy. That’s all.</p>\n<h3>Connie</h3>\n<p>I had learnt a lot from my father before I tried to find out what would be my second career. At first, he had a driving licence for private car. Later, he got two driving licences for lorry and mini van. Simultaneously, he found a job of lorry driver. The reason why he got a driving licence for mini bus was that the government would offer you a driving licence provided that you intended to join that industry. After he had retired, he felt bored and he still got a job of mini van driver. He always reminded me that once you had learnt some skills and knowledge even though it can't help you to earn a living at that moment but it may be useful after a decade. Those skills and knowledge were definately your asset in your life.</p>\n<h3>Ardeshir, Iran</h3>\n<p>I had graduated in physics before I started to learn English . In this country there is not a good job for students of physics. I had worked as a radiation protection supervisor with a bachelor degree before I started my master course. I was actually excelled at physics. unfortunately I could not get my PH.D degree because of my bad luck.3years ago my job was ended,because of the catastrophic conditions in my country. I had not gotten a job and there was no line of work for me so I decided drop a lower grade as a teacher. I had been an unemployed person before I started to teach physics with a low earnings. My bad situation caused to my divorce. Anyway I have invited to a job interview .I must be gutsy to get the job and so on make my world again. But if they do not hire me , I will go to the business world with the rest of my life. I have trust to my instincts.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Angel, Spain</h3>\n<p>The first thing I'd like you to know is comprised in next statement: My illness. Multiple sclerosis, changed my life a lot, at least with reference to work. Acordingly to public institution which control the work Spaniards do, I can't make my job here in Spain as I'd like to.</p>\n<p>So I study English and forex trading everyday to try to enlarge the money which I earn home to maintain home, my wife and two sons, and the pension for the third one.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about what activity was more self rewarding. Studying English, teaching economy or writting some economy articles related wth the time being, would be my preferred activities nowadays.</p>\n<p>Money is not a driver subject right now. I've never had any problem with my wage, or the money I've been paid. Money isn't all what life is about. You have to look something more, being trusted for example.</p>\n<h3>Sam Lo, Taiwan</h3>\n<p>Last year, I planned to apply a summer internship of bank before I entered the graduate school of economics, but I was rejected. In order not to waste my summer vacation time, I made a different decision. I had been a waiter of the Italian restaurant before I started my graduate school life. That was special experience, and I hadn’t known so many things about waiters and restaurants before I started to be a waiter. Although I had quit when I started my graduate school life, I often go to the restaurant to take dinner and meet my ex-colleague.</p>\n<h3>Francois</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of my career, and although I graduated in a Business School, I got through evening courses to improve my skills in banking. So, by the time I applied for a managing position, I had already improved my ability to apply and prove I was the suitable person. And when I got the position, I had already got the skills which made me at ease. I think it's the right way: if you have career goals (which aren't only wishes) you need to prove you really long for reaching them and that you are able to fill the position on offer.</p>\n<h3>Agata, Italy</h3>\n<p>In Italy, in the past, my grandfather received a financial reward and a gold medal at the end of his career, because he had worked for fifty years in the same company.</p>\n<p>Fifty years ago people hadn't matured a period of volunteer, internship or networking like today. Workers had matured credibility, strong human relationship with colleagues and bosses, today some colleagues or bosses are like meteors.</p>\n<p>Everything can change only in one years. If someone thinks to move in another company, after 20 years in the same company, he will be seen as lazy with experienced less!</p>\n<h3>Yu Hui</h3>\n<p>Before I started to pursue my dream career in law, I had worked as a nurse.</p>\n<p>It is never easy to have even an inch of progress in the new career. I had done a part-time law degree before I entered the new career. I worked as a nurse as my full-time job.</p>\n<p>I needed to request for paid or unpaid-leave for examination. That was a daunting experience because, whenever I did it, there were colleagues and seniors asking me to be focused on nursing only, and law was not an option opened for me. However, their discouragement became the booster for my legal study.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I finished my law degree and I will start my job in a law firm very soon.</p>\n<h3>Camilo Arturo</h3>\n<p>When I finished my Master, I didn't want to continue my pHd degree in the same area, so I decided to stop and think, I had stopped during 6 months and I started my pHd in other area more interesting for me.for me.</p>\n<p>I had been studying things that I didn't enjoy, I had to stop and I really make something that I enjoyed a lot.</p>\n<p>I love my research and I want to make things that helps our society. I had needed a moment of my life to stop and thought that I actually wanted to do</p>\n<h3>Araki, Japan</h3>\n<p>I was forced to move into a new line of work because the company I had worked for was about to be closed down. I had been eager and trying to get the company revitalized until the top management decided to give it up. Fortunately, I got offers from several companies then and set mind to join one of them. As I expected, it was hard to adapt myself to new surroundings. Yet, I could keep myself gusty by remembering the word from my friend, \"No setback would be given to the person who is not able to overcome it.\"</p>\n<h3>Francesca, Italy</h3>\n<p>I have a friend named Marco who made a particular choice in his life when he was about 30 years old.</p>\n<p>Everyday he went to a garage, where he was a mechanic; he loved his work, but he felt he could do more. In the evening, when he came home, he always played flute, his preferred instrument that he had studied before he was hired as a mechanic.</p>\n<p>He thought how he could use this passion to help other people, so, in the following period, he decided to make the transition: he followed his instincts and dreams and he call some musician friends to form a band. They began to rehearse together and they were very gutsy to spread music among young and old people during concerts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Marco and his friends became volunteers at the hospital of their town and they still keep sick children company with their beneficial music.</p>\n<h3>Serena</h3>\n<p>Life is not easy for new emigration – no contacts and no networks. I had served as a Marketing Director at China before I moved to Australia. Since I have excellent experience under my belt, I got a job offer as Indent Account Manager in an Importing Company. I had to drop a grade to be in this new work environment. Soon I realized that being full-time-job mum with a six-years-old daughter is challenge, both physical and mental. Before moved to Brisbane, I had studied Aged Care and completed my internship in Melbourne. I am excelled at interpersonal skill and love to chart with elders. I took up the role of AIN at Blue Care after I had moved to Brisbane. It is only two-kilometer distance from my home to work place. The job meets my current needs although I have dropped two grades. I only work four shifts a fortnight, which means I spend more times with my family and plan future career.</p>\n<h3>Rolando, Argentina</h3>\n<p>I am an agricultural engeneer who worked as an assistant professor at</p>\n<p>Univeristy for 15 years. By the time I got my position I had worked as</p>\n<p>a volunteer teacher for 5 years. In 2013 I decided to move to Mar del</p>\n<p>Plata, 400 km south BA so I quit my job. It was the most difficult</p>\n<p>decission I have ever made. Nowadays I have my own small seed company</p>\n<p>and I also work as a garden writer. These activities are not financial</p>\n<p>rewarding but living close to the sea has greatly improved my quality</p>\n<p>of life.</p>\n<h3>Tahnee, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I had worked with graphic production and similar activities for ten years before thinking to change the carrier. At the same time I teach marketing in a technical high school and I believe to keep with this for a long time still. I had studied very hard but I didn't realise that was so important to know more than two languages and other specific technology information knowledges to rise highest marketing positions. I want to direct my professional experience to develop new teaching methods and inspire the students to change their environment and keep the same into private organizations. It's quite difficult because we have a bad infrastructure in our schools. I must to be gutsy to do this.</p>\n<h3>Susana, Spain</h3>\n<p>I had studied hard through all my life. I really feel myself as an eager student, even now. I work as a civil servant since 1991 but it is an absolutely routine job. I took up one specific role inside the Administration and 24 years later…I remain at the same line of job.</p>\n<p>But I didn't stand with my arms crossed. During this time I had taken care of my three children and I also studied Law, several courses of specialization, two Masters and foreign languages… then, </p>\n<p>I think I have got a very important baggage under my belt, however not possible to change my job!!</p>\n<p>I would like to have the opportunity of enjoying an unpaid leave; I would be also willing to move down…I even consider myself gutsy… but three young under my responsibility... it’s not easy!!</p>\n<h3>Erdemerbey, Turkey </h3>\n<p>A few months ago when I arrived home my father hadn't finished his meal so we could make a few conversation and while I and my father talked about my working life he told me you could change your career. You don't have to work in a position that is relevant your graudation. </p>\n<p>It's interesting because thinking about changing career or work life or having a second chance make us more hopeful. İt make us feel better and say us \"yes you can\" but is it true ? İt's a fact that only a few person have real opportunity to change his or her life. </p>\n<p>I think it's a little nonrealistic idea. It's not only about us it's about society. Maybe we should start changing society not only each of us.</p>\n<h3>Patricio</h3>\n<p>I am accountant and in the beginning of my profesional career I started to work in Internal Audit area in a private consultant. I had worked two years in this area when I decided to change to another because I was really boring of this type of job. I moved to IT area to work in SAP consultancy, specifically in logistic module... </p>\n<p>Since four years ago I was hired by an importat company due to I had won a lot experience participating in an important projects.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am particpating an important projects taking a role as leader and I am very motivated in continuous in that direction.</p>\n<h3>Rita</h3>\n<p>I had worked for 6 years in telecommunication companies and also in an access control company. I left my last job due to health problems but i don´t want to think i won´t work any more.</p>\n<p>I teach english lessons to a boy at home but i have the conviction i will be able to improve my teaching ability by improving my own english level,  which is something one is improving all life long.</p>\n<p>I havent stopped  practising english in the last years, at least i have read lots of novels and i have had a go on writing some poems in English too.My favourite music bands and singers are English  and i like to  sing the lyrics while the CD player is working, The point is keeping my English alive and growing for a better future.</p>\n<h3>Svetlana</h3>\n<p>Some years ago I made a great decision for my carrier. I had got a position of the head of a department in a big company. I am a perfectionist, I did my best. I worked hard for three years to make my team better and able to do better work. Hard-working made me exhausted and finally I got that if I would work like this further I would get my health problem. And I refused to be a leader of one of the best department in the company. I chose my health and calmness instead power and money.</p>\n<h3>Raphael, Curitiba, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I've never changed my career but last year, I went to Dublin, Ireland to study English. </p>\n<p>I thought that when I come back to Brazil it would be easy to find a new Job. People here talk that English is very important for Technology companies.</p>\n<p>But it was difficulty to find a job, so I had to accept to earn less than I earn before.</p>\n<h3>Monize Miyada Vargas, Brazil</h3>\n<p>I have contact with some people who changed their careers. For example, my husband’s friend Fred is a doctor now, but he was an engineer student three years ago and he had left his career as an engineering and moved to medicine. At that time, I believe he had lived a hell, because his  parents disagreed about his decision and did not approve that. But, he was determined and today he is very happy with his new job. He is more complete and he does his job with love and compassion. And, believe me, his parents are very proud of him!  So, change your career maybe it can be a  good thing to  do, in the end you must be happy with yourself, this is the most important thing!</p>\n<h3>Pawan</h3>\n<p>Well, I'd say 'Study Change' rather than 'Career Change' in my own words. I had studied science before i decided to move on to the field of management. Science didn't interest me at all with those hefty formulas to go through; I'm rather enjoying finance and accounting. In addition, I'm preparing for internship and would also like to volunteer to gain the much needed working experience. So, now i feel my convictions will lead me to the path of success where I'm hopeful about excelling in my chosen field of study and career of-course.</p>\n<h3>Ília </h3>\n<p>Till now I've changed my career twice. At first time I afforded money to support me during two years, the time to study and get qualifications to move to a new line of work. Some years later I had made redundancy. The time I get unemployed give the free time needed to get more qualifications. But starting a new career means drop a grad or two with significant reduction on salary. So with some contacts and some experience I decided to manage towards the specialization in the current career. </p>\n<h3>Oni </h3>\n<p>In 2014, I graduated from my university and while waiting my graduation ceremony, I decided to be a teacher in a private school. My school’s condition was bad because all of the school aspects were poor. But, I thought it was an internship before leaving my university.</p>\n<p>However, after six months and I had done my graduation ceremony, I thought I needed to have a better job because at that time I lived independently. Consequently, I chose to leave my job and tried to find another line of work. I was confident because of my experiences under my belt. But, in reality, it didn’t run well. I was in unpaid leave for three months and I realized that contact and networking were very important.</p>\n<p>Then in the fourth month I got a new job but I had to drop a grade. I took up the role of a elementary school teacher, whereas I wanted to move sideways.</p>\n<h3>Nouf, Yemen</h3>\n<p>I have been working in the line of work for eight years. I had worked as a Secretary before this job, but I hadn’t an interest in being a Secretary.</p>\n<p>I want to change a bit, because I have been under the same title for eight years. I tried to be open-minded and improve myself and my qualifications, I am eager to learn. So, I completed my University degree in Law and I graduated. I am planning to move sideways with the help of my good contacts and some experience under my belt, and look for a better opportunity.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's it for this session.

I'm Catherine…</br></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Neil, like your hat!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you very much. It's cold outside, so I thought it would be <strong>sensible </strong>to wear a woolly hat.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>My ears are very <strong>sensitive</strong> to the cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I've noticed your ears looking a little bit red of a morning, occasionally, Neil. And the words <strong>sensible</strong> and <strong>sensitive </strong>are good examples of today's topic. The two words look and sound similar, but they have very different meanings. And in this programme we're going to talk about more pairs of words that people sometimes get mixed up.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now let's now hear about Mike. He was in a shop yesterday when he made a mistake.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Think about this question while you listen: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>Mike felt <strong>bored</strong>. He was watching a <strong>boring</strong> film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know – I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'. The <strong>recipe</strong> looked easy – just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>. But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar. He went to the shop and bought some. The cake looked great. But it tasted horrible. Mike checked the <strong>receipt</strong>. He'd bought salt by mistake!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we asked you: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is: He bought salt instead of sugar.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, the <strong>receipt</strong> said 'salt' but the <strong>recipe, </strong>of course, said 'sugar'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The nouns <strong>receipt </strong>and <strong>recipe </strong>look very similar, but they have different meanings. A <strong>receipt</strong>, r – e – c – e – i – p – t, is a document that shows you have paid money for something.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and a <strong>recipe</strong>, r – e – c – i – p – e, is a set of cooking instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Listen to a clip from Mike's story. Can you spot two more confusing words?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>He was watching a boring film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know – I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that's<strong> desert</strong> and <strong>dessert</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yep. Now a <strong>desert </strong>is an area of land where very little can grow and there's very little water. <strong>Desert, </strong>d – e – s – e – r – t, has one 's', but <strong>dessert</strong>, d – e – s – s – e – r – t, has two 's'. A <strong>dessert</strong> is a sweet food course that we eat at the end of a meal. Right. Moving on. Neil, what do you do when you are <strong>bored</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I find making cakes <strong>boring</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. When I'm <strong>bored</strong>, I knit.  </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You knit?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Of course - the hat! The woolly hat!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I knitted this woolly hat.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's fantastic!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Bored</strong> and <strong>boring</strong> – both adjectives, but with very different meanings.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Bored</strong>, b – o – r – e – d, describes how someone is feeling, when they are not interested in something. <strong>Boring</strong>, b – o – r – i – n – g, describes a thing that is not very interesting.

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>    <br/>In this programme we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>We'll tell you what they are and how they’re used.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>We'll give you some tips to help you understand the difference between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we'll also have a quiz to test your understanding.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>Right. Let's get started. Finn, can you tell us about adjectives first.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>OK. Certainly, let's start with a simple example. What am I holding up?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>    <br/>You've got two biscuits, Finn . One is <strong>plain </strong>and one is <strong>chocolate</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>Yes. Do you like both?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I do.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Me too. In that sentence there were two adjectives, <strong>plain </strong>and <strong>chocolate</strong>. What do those words do?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>Well, Finn. Those words describe the biscuits.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>That's right. Adjectives are describing words: they tell us about nouns. In this case they tell us about the biscuits. A <strong>plain </strong>biscuit. A <strong>chocolate </strong>biscuit.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine    <br/></strong>Fantastic. What else do adjectives describe?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>Lots of things. They can also describe pronouns. Listen out for the adjective <strong>happy</strong> in this example. Here's Neil</p>\n<p><strong>Neil   <br/></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>   <br/>The adjective <strong>happy</strong> - what did that refer to?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It referred to the pronoun <strong>he</strong>, which in this example was Peter.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, Peter was <strong>happy</strong>. He was <strong>happy</strong>. He was a <strong>happy</strong> Peter.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So adjectives are words that give us information or additional information about nouns. When it comes to adverbs there is a bit of a clue in the name, isn't there, Finn?Ad – verb, add information about a verb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That is one thing that adverbs do. They give us information about verbs. They can tell us how someone does something or how something happens. Now, let's listen again to the example. As well as the adjective <strong>happy </strong>there's also an adverb in the sentence. What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peter played <strong>well</strong>. After the game he was <strong>happy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The adverb there was <strong>well</strong>. Peter played <strong>well</strong>. The word <strong>well</strong> isn't describing Peter himself: it's describing how he did what he did.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT          <br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We've seen that adjectives describe nouns and adverbs talk about verbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You mentioned that referring to verbs was only one thing that adverbs do. So, where else can we use them?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Adverbs can also describe adjectives, and even other adverbs. Remember the biscuits?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong>    <br/>I'm looking at them right now, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Look good, don’t they?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They do!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn   <br/></strong>What do you feel when you see the biscuits?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I feel hungry!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Is hungry an adjective or adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It is an adjective because it's describing me, my feeling – and I'm a noun!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You are a noun! And now if I ask you how hungry you are, what would you say?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well the chocolate biscuit in particular is making me feel <strong>very</strong> hungry.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> Very</strong> hungry. <strong>Very</strong>. Hungry. What is the word <strong>very </strong>referring to? Is it you, the noun?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>No, it's the adjective <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Exactly.<strong> Very </strong>is an adverb. So as well as adding information about verbs, adverbs can also tell us about adjectives. And they can even tell us about other adverbs. Let's hear our earlier example again please, Neil?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Remember that the word <strong>well</strong> is an adverb. But how <strong>well</strong> did Peter play?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peter played <strong>really</strong> <strong>well</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right. So here the word <strong>really </strong>is telling us about the adverb <strong>well</strong>. How <strong>well</strong>? <strong>Really</strong> <strong>well</strong>. <strong>Really </strong>is also an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So adverbs can tell us about verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And adjectives describe nouns and pronouns. And now, it's quiz time.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We are going to give you a word, and read a sentence which contains the word. You need to decide if the word we give you is an adjective or an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. So, here's the first one. The word is <strong>blue</strong> and here's the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>. The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, is <strong>blue</strong> an adjective or adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>It’s an adjective. <strong>Blue</strong> is describing the noun sky. Now number two: it's actually the same sentence but this time, think about the word <strong>dark</strong>. Is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or an adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The sky is <strong>dark</strong> blue.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. So, is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or adverb?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><strong>Dark</strong> here is an adverb. Now number three. This time there are three words to listen out for: <strong>delicious</strong>, <strong>very</strong> and <strong>slowly</strong> – are they adjectives or adverbs?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Catherine ate the <strong>delicious</strong> biscuit <strong>very</strong> <strong>slowly</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>No, she didn't. She ate it very fast. But, did you get them? <strong>Delicious</strong> is an adjective. It describes the noun biscuit.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Slowly </strong>is an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And finally, <strong>very</strong> is also an adverb.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So that's our introduction to adjectives and adverbs</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong>   <br/>There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for  soon more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>\n<p><strong>Both</strong>  <br/>Bye.</p>\n<p><strong>STING</strong></p> </div>",
        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>A gentle reminder</h3>\n<p>You know about adjectives and adverbs, don't you?</p>\n<p>You know that adjectives describe nouns, and that adverbs give information about a verb…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adjectives</strong>: <em>Rufus has an <strong>expensive</strong> car. It has <strong>leather</strong> seats.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Adverbs</strong>: <em>He drives it very <strong>slowly</strong> and <strong>carefully</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there's more to adjectives and adverbs than that. In Activity 1 we're going to remind ourselves about the differences between these parts of speech. In Activity 2 we're looking at some <strong>irregular</strong> examples.</p>\n<h3>Adjectives – meaning and use</h3>\n<p>As we've said, adjectives tell us about nouns. They also tell us about pronouns like he, she and it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>He's very <strong>unhappy</strong>.</em></li>\n<li><em>She's <strong>stunning</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"GrammarBank\">Adjectives – Form</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Most of them have no particular form, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Happy, sad, light, green, quick, busy, large</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Though some are made by adding a suffix to a noun or verb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Fun – <strong>funny</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Week<strong> - weekly</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Child – <strong>childlike</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Fool – <strong>foolish</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Care<strong> – careful</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Accept<strong> – acceptable</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adverbs – meaning and use</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">You know that adverbs tell us about verbs, but did you know they also tell us about adjectives and other adverbs?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>It was a <strong>very</strong> sunny day. </em>(The adverb <strong>very</strong> refers to the adjective <strong>sunny</strong>. It tells us how sunny it was.)</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><em>He finished the exam <strong>really</strong> <strong>quickly</strong>. </em>(The adverb <strong>really</strong> refers to the adverb <strong>quickly</strong>. It tells us how quickly he finished.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adverbs - form</h3>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">Many adverbs can be made by adding the suffix <strong>–ly</strong> to an adjective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Sad – <strong>sadly</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Serious<strong> – seriously</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Quiet<strong> – quietly</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Total<strong> – totally</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Careful<strong> - carefully</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Sleepy - <strong>sleepily</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\">Slow<strong> - slowly</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"GrammarBank\">But others have no regular structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><strong>Soon</strong>, <strong>well</strong>, <strong>never, quite</strong>, <strong>often, already, just</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Story</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Singapore is a <strong>very</strong> <strong>diverse</strong>, <strong>multicultural</strong> country. The biggest <strong>ethnic</strong> group is Chinese. They make up about 75% of the population. Other significant groups are the Malays and Indians. The country has four <strong>official</strong> languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, and most Singaporeans speak at least two of them <strong>fluently</strong>. In addition, a creole called Singlish is spoken <strong>widely</strong>, though this is <strong>officially</strong> discouraged by the government. The country has changed very <strong>fast</strong> in the last few decades as the economy has grown <strong>quickly</strong>. </span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Next</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Did you notice the word <strong>fast</strong> in that game? It can be both an adjective and an adverb. We look at a few irregular examples like this in the next activity.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Or hardly working?</h3>\n<p><span><span>So, are you <strong>working hard</strong> right now? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Whether you are or not, we have a question: what is the word <strong>hard</strong> in that sentence? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>It's an <strong>adverb</strong> – it gives more information about the way you are working. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But <strong>hard</strong> can also be adjective: <em>it's a <strong>hard</strong> job, that bed is <strong>hard</strong>.</em></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Hard is an example of a word which is both an adjective and an adverb. Other examples are:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span><span>Fast</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><span>Late</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><span>Early</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><span>High</span></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span>In that case, what does <strong>hardly</strong> mean? Actually, it's not connected to hard – it means <strong>barely</strong>, only a little. So if you're <strong>hardly working</strong>, you're not working very much at all!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Similarly, these are examples of adverbs which don't always mean what you think:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><strong>Lately</strong> (means <strong>recently</strong>: How have you been lately?)</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><strong>Highly</strong> (means <strong>favourably</strong>: His boss thinks highly of him)</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Note 1</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>After sense verbs like look, taste, smell, feel and sound, we often use the adjective form, as if it was an adverb:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em><span><span>That sounds bad / You look angry / She smells terrible / I feel awful</span></span></em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span><span>Note 2</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><span><span>Also, it's good to remember that not all words ending in –ly are adverbs. For example:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><span><span>That was a <strong>silly</strong> thing to do. (Adjective)</span></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><span><span>He was a <strong>bully</strong> at school. (Noun)</span></span></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"GrammarBank\"><span><span>You have to <strong>apply</strong> for the job. (Verb)</span></span></div>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Let's do an exercise where you have to select the right word. It could either be an adverb or an adjective, regular or irregular.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done.

Not everyone has agreed they are art.</br></p>\n<p>(Top left, Flying Machine by Carsten Holler; top right, Self Portrait by Vincent Van Gogh; bottom left, some graffiti street art; bottom right, Fountain by Marcel Duchamp)</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Now you're going to read an article adapted from a video blog by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz. He recently visited an exhibition in London which displayed flying machines and slides. It made him ask himself: what is art?</p>\n<p><strong>Before you read</strong></p>\n<p>Look at these two summaries. Then read the article once, quite quickly, and decide which summary is correct.</p>\n<p>1. Will Gompertz thinks that not everything in an art gallery is really art.</p>\n<p>2. Will Gompertz thinks that if an object is in a gallery, it is art.</p>\n<h3>Is it Art?</h3>\n<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br/>In 1917, a French artist called Marcel Duchamp bought a <strong>urinal</strong>, laid it on its back, signed and entered it for an art exhibition. The committee were <strong>appalled</strong>, they thought it was <strong>disgusting</strong> and <strong>vulgar</strong>, and certainly not a work of art.</p>\n<p>But after Duchamp, the art world started to believe that anything an artist puts into a gallery <strong>automatically</strong> becomes a work of art. Can that be right?</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>An exhibition of the German artist Carsten Holler's work has opened at London's Hayward Gallery. It is full of <strong>playful</strong> <strong>installations</strong>, which the visitor is invited to <strong>interact</strong> with. These include a <strong>spiralling</strong> slide, a flying machine, two <strong>remote control</strong> beds, and <strong>goggles</strong> that turn the world upside down.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>But are his flying machines and spiralling slides works of art? If they were in a theme park I'm not sure that we would think so. At least Duchamp changed the context for his urinal – he didn't install it in a bathroom in a local art gallery. He stopped it from having any <strong>functional</strong> purpose at all – he put it in a gallery, laid it on its back, and called it a sculpture.</p>\n<p>He was asking us if art has to be beautiful and why it has to be made by an artist. The urinal sculpture became a way of delivering his message and so I think yes, it's an artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>But I'm not so sure that I'd call Carsten Holler's interactive installations artwork. They are fairground-type rides that happen to be in an art gallery. Their purpose and function hasn't changed at all and I reacted to them as if I was at a <strong>funfair</strong>. Maybe I'm missing some <strong>profound</strong> point but I <strong>just</strong> found them <strong>amusing</strong> - a distraction. They didn't <strong>move</strong> me like a great Picasso painting or indeed many works by Duchamp.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5</strong><br/>I'm not saying that Carsten Holler isn't an artist but just that not everything he says is art is <strong>necessarily</strong> art. And I think that applies to many other artists and their installations in galleries. It's time, I think, to question what is and what isn't art.</p>\n<p>This article was based on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33109199\" target=\"_self\">video blog </a>by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz.</p>\n<h3>Which was the correct summary?</h3>\n<p>The correct summary was:</p>\n<p>1. Will Gompertz thinks that not everything in an art gallery is really art.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge of adverbs and adjectives. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 3</h3>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed that discussion about art and learned some interesting adjectives. In Session 4 Finn interviews artist Shan Pillay - the man who created the artwork for our drama, Alice in Wonderland!</p></div>",

I'm joined in the studio by the artist Shan Pillay who did the pictures for the Alice in Wonderland drama series. Hi Shan.</br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Hello there Finn.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>How's it going?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>It's going very well. Very well indeed.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Great. So before we go any further, lets listen to a clip from Alice in Wonderland.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>INSERT</strong><br/></span></span><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Alice found the March Hare and the Hatter, having a tea-party.</p>\n<p><strong>Hatter and March Hare<br/></strong>Would you like some tea? Tea, yes please! And cake? One cake, two cakes... One lump or two? Sugar?</p>\n<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Curiouser and curiouser. They're having a tea-party. But where are all the guests?</p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>So the tea party scene there. Lots of fun and noise and <strong>clinking</strong> of cups. And we have a wonderful picture of it Shan. Can you describe what's in the picture? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>It's a <strong>chaotic</strong> <strong>scene</strong>, drawn from Alice's <strong>point of view</strong>. So it's a <strong>lively</strong> <strong>image</strong>, it's done in a fun, <strong>cartoonish</strong> style with <strong>bold</strong> <strong>outlines</strong>. And along with the <strong>deranged</strong> Mad Hatter we have the <strong>equally</strong> mad March Hare. And both are dressed rather <strong>flamboyantly</strong>, don't you think?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Yes. So the Mad Hatter's wearing quite a <strong>garish</strong>, green top hat and a big bow tie. And the March Hare has got a pink bow tie and a <strong>purple</strong> suit jacket. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>And a <strong>ruffled</strong> shirt.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>That's great. A ruffled shirt, good.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>And of course the other character who's in here, sitting in the teapot, is the dormouse. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Ah, so tell me about the dormouse.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Well this character is quite <strong>sleepy</strong>. You can see he's <strong>sleepily</strong> sitting in the teapot. And this is shown in his <strong>droopy</strong> ears and <strong>half-closed</strong> eyes. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>That's right. His droopy ears – his ears are hanging down. And his half-closed eyes. He must be quite sleepy, but can he be sleepy with all this <strong>madness</strong> happening around him? </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Yes, he looks quite <strong>alarmed</strong> that he's been woken up from a <strong>slumber</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>He does. Now let's look at the next picture, which is of the Cheshire Cat, which is… what are those colours? Indigo?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>A <strong>purplish-indigo</strong> and <strong>turquoise</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Purplish-indigo and turquoise, and yellow eyes and yellow teeth. So what's happening here?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Well this is the Cheshire cat and he's appeared in the tree above Alice. You can see the expression on his face, it's a slightly <strong>creepy</strong> smile that suggests a <strong>mischievous</strong> personality. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>There's something going on, you're not quite sure what he's thinking, are you? So tell me about the teeth. What's the idea with the teeth?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Well I love that I did the mouth from one end to the other, it goes right across his face like going from America to England.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>It's almost as big as his body.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>And it looked good, it looked creepy. But I experimented with some colours some more, and I discovered that this bright yellow, that matched the yes as well, just <strong>heightened</strong> the creepiness of the smile if you like.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>It does. It's already creepy and you've heightened it, you've made it even more creepy, you've heightened the creepiness, by making it yellow. That's fantastic. Thank you, thank you Shan very much for coming here and telling us about your pictures today.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Shan</strong><br/>Oh it's been a pleasure.</span></span></p> </div>",

They're from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-21/session-5\">Alice in Wonderland</a> drama. In the top one there are three characters, from left to right: the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse. In the bottom one we have Alice and the Cheshire Cat.</p>\n<p>How would you describe these images?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Look at the pictures and listen to the audio</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Now we're now going to listen to an interview with the artist who made these pictures. His name is Shan Pillay, and he uses lots of adjectives and adverbs when talking about the characters in his pictures, for example:</p>\n<p><strong>sleepy</strong> <br/>tired and wanting to sleep</p>\n<p><strong>flamboyantly</strong> <br/>brightly coloured, confidently</p>\n<p><strong>deranged</strong> <br/>mad</p>\n<p>Which words do you think he will use to describe which character?</p>\n<p>All the definitions are in the Session Vocabulary box.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Listen to the interview and then answer the questions.

The one below is from Episode 8 of our drama Jamaica Inn. There are two characters: Mary on the left, and someone called Mrs Bassat on the right.</p>\n<p>In fewer than 100 words, can you describe it?</p>\n<p>If you like, you can talk about the four aspects of style, colour, atmosphere and character. Try to use lots of adjectives and adverbs.</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Daniela, Italy</h3>\n<p>In a peaceful place in a house that it similar to a library two women are worried about something that happened.</p>\n<p>The character on the left, sat on an ancient green armchair, wearing a long dress of indefinite colour - maybe light green or dirty white - looks very scared with her hands opened close to her skinny cheeks and her lips half opened in a suffering cry.</p>\n<p>The woman on the right, standing in her light violet long dress, directs her glance to her in a worried expression. Maybe something was happened and both they are scared.</p>\n<h3>Erika, Brazil</h3>\n<p>Mary looks terrified, she is sitting in the chair with an Alarmed expression like something really bad happened, Mrs Basssat is right by her side but standing up looking droopy about Mary's reaction.</p>\n<p>Both are them are surrounded by a very sad atmosphere, a library colorless, Mary is wearing a very old green dress, similarly is Mrs Bassat wearing a dress, however is a purple one and looks very old fashioned.</p>\n<p>The scene is very intrigued.</p>\n<h3><strong>Manoel, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>Sitting in a green chair, Mary is shocked about the news she have heard. Her aunt wearing a purplish dress, is looking at her but she doesn't know what to do. Mary thinks she must run away. But Mrs Bassat is a elderly woman and Mary is worried that her aunt does not have another place to go.</p>\n<h3>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>That is a realistic style painting with characters in a room and they are in different emotion. The main colours of the picture are dark, grey and cold that make the picture a little bit dreary.</p>\n<p>The characters are two women, one is standing, Mrs. Bassat, and the other is Mary who is sitting on a chair. Mary looks frightened. Her full-opened eyes and hanging up hands look like a person who is unwillingly witnessing a frightening scene. By contrast, Mrs. Bassat looks emotionless.</p>\n<p>The largest colour pieces of the picture are the walls, the floor and two book shelves, and the characters. The walls are dark ivory, the floor and the book shelves  are dark grey and the books are mainly dark brown and dark green. The characters are also painted palely.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the painting describes an alarming scene by using dark and cold colors and pale emotion of the main character, Mary.</p>\n<h3>Anderson</h3>\n<p>It is an uneasy scene. Mary and Mrs Bassat are in a room that appears to be a study painted with simple brown colour. Mary is wearing a turquoise night gown, sitting in an armchair and looks horrified, she might just have received some terrible news that came to her as a severe blow. Her hands are trying to cup her stricken face to calm herself down. Mrs Bassat is standing beside her, she is wearing a purplish dress and a slightly paler apron over the dress at the front, apparently she is deeply concerned about how Mary's reaction to the news.</p>\n<h3>Khalid, Yemen</h3>\n<p>The picture refer to a dramatic scene, and it shows an emergency situation in a serious atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Through the picture I can see two characters who are Mary and Mrs Bassat they might be relatives, because when I look at the room which they are in, I see poor features, so they can not afford a home-maid.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, the atmosphere is shocking, that appears on  Mary's face and her hands are up near to her face also, but when I look at Mrs Bassat's face I do not see shocking features, by contrast, I see sadness features, so I think she is who told Mary bad news.</p>\n<p>The family - if I consider them as a family - lived in the past time from now, considering the type of the clothes which they are wearing, they are old-fashion. They are poor people, so their room painted with simple brown colour which differs from light to dark and white colour,also there are some cracks below the window beside the door.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, they concern about knowledge that why they have a lot of books.</p>\n<h3><strong>Maria, </strong><strong>Brazil</strong><strong>​</strong></h3>\n<p>This is an indoor scene, showing two women who seem to be having a serious conversation.</p>\n<p>We can observe two book shelves and an open door on the back, the artist uses dark colors on scene, that makes us believe that something unpleasant is happening. </p>\n<p>The younger woman in white has a scared expression, her hands reach her face. The other woman in a lavender dress seems worried. Both wear long sleeves representing that it might be cold in there.</p>\n<h3>Vasyl, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>There are two characters in the dark purplish and turquoise and brown-coloured room. Mary, the young lady uncomfortably sitting on a chair, seems really scared. The woman staying nearby looks at Mary suspiciously. Both of them are dressed simply and modestly. Their attires look quite domestic. An atmosphere depicted on the image is rather taut.</p>\n<h3>Airin, Japan</h3>\n<p>This picture is drawn in a gloomy style. The lines are solid and the colours are all dull. </p>\n<p>Two women are in a room. One sits in an arm chair covering her face with her hands as if she is shocked by something really frightening. The other woman stands besides her, looking down the floor with a serious face. She may be searching a way to solve a critical problem. Both of them are in plain dresses without any flamboyant things.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of books in shelves along the wall. None of them look attractive because their covers are all either dark green or dark purple. The books probably have not read by anyone for long.</p>\n<p>We can sense serious, creepy, horrifying atmosphere in the room.</p>\n<h3>Tiziano, Verona, Italy</h3>\n<p>The picture is neither funny nor sunny. In fact through the window you can see a cloudy weather that gives you a bit of sadness.</p>\n<p>The colours aren't lively, they're dark and gloomy. The floor and the library are brown. The designer hasn't used bright colors. Consequently the atmosphere becomes melancholy and unhappy.</p>\n<p>Maria sits on a green chair that doesn't reflect much light, she seems upset and worried. Maria wears a light-green dress, typically used at the beginning of the 20th century. Instead the woman next to Maria wears a purple dress, she seems to be alarmed and powerless.</p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>That scene describes the point of view of the writer about how is one of rooms the Jamaica inn. The cartoon are not funny and its characters are quite sad. The atmosphere in that room is very lugubrious and the brown and purplish colors are correct to express the sadness and despair that Mary live that place.</p>\n<p>The room where are they is similar to a library and the window behind of Mary allows us to imagine a fog day in this town. </p>\n<h3>Alessandra</h3>\n<p>This picture tells us of a very sad and worried atmosphere. The drawing shows us an elegant room, maybe the library of a distinguished house, but the darkness all around and the expression of the two women portrayed in it make us feel how dramatic the moment must be! Sat on the chair Mary, in her pale green dress, looks terrified, frightened as someone who has just seen a ghost. Beside her, the older woman, Mrs. Bassat, in her light violet dress seems to be very worried about something... What has happened?</p>\n<h3>Pavel, Russia</h3>\n<p>This picture made in gloomy style. Despite of different colors, not dark at all, there are light yellow part of wall, bright colored dressed on the two women, in general the picture transmit negative associations. It particularly because the young girl, who sits in a chair, and looks really scary and frightened about something. And women opposite her not looks equally scary, but more thoughtful and moodily. That even makes the whole atmosphere more strange and mysterious.</p>\n<h3>Manuel Angel, Spain</h3>\n<p>It's an ordered room full it up with completly ordered bookshelves for decoration purposes and two main characters from the story we are dealing. First one Mary, poorly dressed like a servant; and Mrs. Basset, her aunt, flamboyantly dressed wearing an indigo dress. The main colour is brown trying to create the misterious tone of the scene.</p>\n<h3>Zosia, Poland</h3>\n<p>The picture is gloomy, colours like brown and dark-purple heightened a bleakness. A girl on the left, Mary, is sitting in an armchair. She has dark hair and is wearing a light-coloured dress. She looks frightened and worried. A woman on the right in bright-purple dress is Mrs Bassat. She is older than Mary. She is thoughtful, serious and sad. It seems like Mary has to make an important decision.</p>\n<h3>Ewa, Poland</h3>\n<p>The scene of Jamaica Inn is in the sharp, meaty drawing style. Only one colour - violet - is determined. It could be that the person who wear it is the most important one. The rest of colours are dun and dirty. Atmosphere of Mary's point of view seems frightening, heavy and uncertain. On the other hand Mrs Basset seems to be just a little concerned. She is deep in thought and looking for solutions. There is a kind of gloom in this picture...</p>\n<h3>Yamelith</h3>\n<p>The atmosphere of the room is dark and heavy as well as the weather that we can see through the window – a dull cloudy sky. The sorrowful of the scene kills any feeling of happiness.<br>Mary looks completely shocked and scared as if Mrs Bassat had told her some terrible news or secrets. Mary's appearance is even worse because she is in a pale filthy white dress and it shows the poverty and hard time that Mary is dealing with.<br/>Mrs Bassat face expression is quite stoical but her wrinkly skin tells us about her worries and unhappy life.</br></p>\n<h3>Clarice, Italy</h3>\n<p>In the image, I see a gothic style.<br/>Mrs Bassat has a lilac dress and Mary a grey dress. The wall is a clear yellow, but the floor and the bookcase are very dark.<br/>The atmosphere is very gloomy, the room is dark the light comes only from the room that is behind.<br/>Mary is worried and troubled. Mrs Bassat seems to think how to resolve the problem she seems absorbed.</p>\n<h3>NGUYỄN VĂN ĐẠT, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>There are two characters in this picture. Mary on the left, she’s using her hands to cover her face. She looks really shock. Her hair is not very neat, it’s wet. She’s wearing a white-ruffled dress. She’s been in a river or a stream and experienced a chaotic scene, I guess. Totally, She must be frightened of something.</p>\n<p>About Mrs. Bassat, She’s in a violet dress. Her hair is very neat and her mouth is hanging down. It makes me think of rich and mischievous woman. She’s concentrating what happened shown on Mary’s face.</p>\n<p>Everything is in a library.</p>\n<h3>Georges Noel</h3>\n<p>The room is in darkness. Mary is sitting in a green chair and seems really frightened. She ups her two hands as to shield her face or to shut her ears against an unpleasant noise or a scream or a loudly cry. Mrs Bassat, upright, looks at far and appears severe but strong, the left arm, hung up, hand closed, as to fight or perhaps to protect herself. She is wearing a purple dress. Her yellow hairs are like to increase their possible grey colour. This choice increases her old face. By the back door, appears the light old painting of the other room.</p>\n<h3>Anazilda</h3>\n<p>The whole scene is a little creepy.  The atmosphere is oppressive and scary.  Mary seems to be alarmed, she looks at something out of the scene as she was afraid of what she sees.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bassat is wearying a purple  dress, what makes her contrast with the rest of the cartoon, mainly green, yellow and brown. She seems to be an unpleasant woman, ruthless and cold-hearted.</p>\n<p>The room is a little dark, with heavy shelves, but bright sunlight comes from the window in the other room, behind the door.</p>\n<h3>Micol, Torino</h3>\n<p>The scene is dramatic: it's drawn by cartoonish style but it isn't cheerful, the colours are dark,the books on the bookshelves are brown and dark-green, there are shadows on the walls.</p>\n<p>A young woman is setting, she's crouched and her eyes are scared. She's wearing a white dress,she's looking at something which has scared her. Near the girl there is an old woman, she's wearing a long, purple dress and she has an apron over the dress, her hair is grey. She's looking at the youmg woman but she can't help her.</p>\n<h3>Manuel, Panamá</h3>\n<p>In a dark and sepia illuminated room, that look antique and sad, somethiing like a kind of library room, there are two persons, a sadly face old woman dressing a purple clothes and a apron, and a girl sitting in a old green chair,  with a sacared and worry attitud, maby alarmed for something.  The illustration was made with acrylic painting or made with adobe Photoshop software.</p>\n<h3>Rita, Spain</h3>\n<p>The drawing is quite realistic, showing a decoration and clothes which match perfectly the XIXth style.</p>\n<p>The colours used by the artist are fade, cold and with a lack of happiness.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is uncomfortable , with a point of fear. Makes one feel concerned about both women, especially Mary.</p>\n<p>Mary shows a terrible face, She is pale and looks really scared.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bassat seems to be upset and worried about Mary but her pose shows she is determined to help her and find a definiitive solution for Mary´s suffering.</p>\n<p>The furniture, the books and the room tidines lead me to think that they are not in Jamaica Inn, they might very likely be at Mrs. Bassat´s.</p>\n<h3>Thomas</h3>\n<p>In this scene two women are staying in a paneled room of an old mansion. On the left Mary is sitting on a green cushioned chair her face lined with stress and her eyes looking creepy. Right next to her Mrs Basset ist standing in a ruffled purplish-indigo colored apron looking rather droopy.</p>\n<h3>Ammår</h3>\n<p>this is bad atmosphere at all , Mary is scared and set in old chair and spot on her ante , Mrs Basssat in right of picture she still stand up and looks tired , there is old books library . </p>\n<p>the weather out side this room looks cloudy and rainy </p>\n<h3>Pawan</h3>\n<p>It's a melancholic scene, with Mary looking appalled and Mrs.Bassat deeply concerned, they portray an alarming event. Marry, with those ruffled dress, greenish in color, look dreadful. She must have heard some horrid news from Mrs. Bassat who doesn't seem as horrified as she is. Mrs. Bassat's gloomy face, with blonde hair, also indicates some sinister happening. Furthermore, the old-fashioned furniture, rugged clothes, rather dark room adds dreariness to the scene.  </p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>This picture shows two persons in a room which gives some sad feelings, owing to the fact that colours are not very flamboyant. On the left, Mary seems quite frightened, and on the right Mrs Bassad has a vacant look and appears very confused. The clothes they are wearing are pleated and suggest that they have been enduring tough circumstances. So the atmoshpere is very tense, oppressive as if something went or will go amiss.</p>\n<h3>Ília</h3>\n<p>Mary appears very frightened sat down on a chair with her hands raised in front of her paled face and Mrs Bassat stands up with a worried expression as something bad had happened. The women are in a library full of books in a heavy atmosphere even colours <br/> without blow expresses sadness. Both are wearing ruffled garments which underlines the scenario of mistery. <br/> The room and the way characters are dressed take us to a country style on XIX century.</p>\n<h3>Mohammad Al Afifi, Palestine</h3>\n<p>In an upset scene Mary is  emotionally chocked setting on an old chair, Mrs. Bassat is standing near Mary and looking at her sadly, Both of them are wearing old fashioned clothes with pale colors. The room is surrounded with green, purple and brown books, It looks like a small library, Room's door is open into corridor with glass window.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is really full of fear and anxiety.</p>\n<h3>Swam, Myanmar</h3>\n<p> This picture is a classic, dull and a vividly coloured image at a library.Mary is wearing  sand-like clothes while Mrs Bassat is wearing a pale purplish dress. It seems like a distressing situation as Mary seems tearful. She probably wants to tell Mrs Bassat about her terrible experiences she had on the ship. Mary looks tearful while Mrs Bassat seems a bit tense.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is an interesting image.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>That's the end of this session.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and me Catherine. And in this programme we're talking about the letters <strong>o-u-g-h. </strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, the letters <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>are found in lots of English words including <strong>cough</strong>,<strong> rough</strong>,<strong> ought </strong>and<strong> through</strong>, but there are lots of different pronunciations. So let's start with George. He's talking about last winter, when he was ill.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And think about this question while you listen: What did George do in February?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/> George<br/></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months. By February, I <strong>thought </strong>I <strong>ought</strong> to go to the doctor. He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check and some medicine. It got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the <strong>cough</strong> lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April. I'm so glad spring's here!</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Poor George. And we asked: what did George do in February?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, George <strong>thought</strong> that he <strong>ought </strong>to go to the doctor. So that's what he did.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Good. Now the words <strong>thought</strong>, spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h-t </strong>and <strong>ought</strong>, spelt <strong>o-u-g-h-t,</strong> both have the <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>pattern in them and it's pronounced <strong>or</strong>. <strong>Thought, ought</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Thought,<strong> ought</strong>.<strong> </strong>And there are more <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> verbs with the same pronunciation, like <strong>fought</strong>, the past of <strong>fight</strong>, and <strong>bought</strong>, the past of <strong>buy</strong>...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...and <strong>brought</strong>,<strong> b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>, the past of <strong>bring</strong>. People sometimes confuse <strong>bought </strong>and <strong>brought</strong> so Catherine, can you give us an example sentence with both words?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I <strong>bought</strong> a new TV from the hypermarket and I <strong>brought</strong> it home in a taxi.</p>\n<p>Now let's have another clip. And how <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>words are there in this one?</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>George<br/></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So there were two <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> words there: <strong>Cough</strong>:<strong> c-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>roughly</strong>:<strong> r-o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>. <strong>Roughly</strong> means <strong>about</strong>, so George had a <strong>cough</strong> for about - or <strong>roughly</strong> - three months.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But the pronunciation of these two words is different. The <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> cough</strong> sounds like <strong>off</strong>.<strong> Off</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> roughly</strong> sounds like <strong>uff</strong>.<strong> Uff</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. So we're beginning to see that there is no real rule for pronouncing these words, Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Sadly not, that's right. You are just going to have to learn to spell and say each word on its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Let's have another clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>George<br/></strong>He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the<strong> o-u-g-h </strong>word there was <strong>thorough</strong>:<strong> t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h</strong>. It means <strong>very careful and exact</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the pronunciation is different again. Listen to this one: <strong>thorough</strong>. It's an <strong>uh </strong>sound at the end of the word.<strong> Uh</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>, <strong>uh</strong>,<strong> thorough.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Here's one more clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>George<br/></strong>I got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the cough lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>This time we heard <strong>although</strong> spelt<strong> a-l-t-h-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>through, </strong>spelt<strong> t-h-r-o-u-g-h</strong>.  Now the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in <strong>although, </strong>sounds like <strong>oh</strong>.<strong> Although</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And in<strong> through</strong>, it sounds like <strong>ooo</strong>. <strong>Through</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So you know what, that gives us six different pronunciations for the letters <strong>o-u-g-h</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, six of them. We had: <strong>thought</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>,<strong> although </strong>and <strong>through</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So in fact there are more than six pronunciations for <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in the English language, but these are the most common ones.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English. </p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And now it's time for the quiz! OK, question number one: How do you spell <strong>brought</strong>, the past simple of the verb <strong>bring</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's <strong>b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> Very good. Number two: How do you pronounce the word that is spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's <strong>though</strong>. <strong>Though</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> That's the one. Number three: <strong>Roughly</strong> and <strong>enough</strong> have similar spelling and pronunciation. How do you spell <strong>roughly</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's <strong>r</strong>-<strong>o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done if you got all those right. Now before we go, here's our vocabulary tip. If your phone or computer lets you record audio, try recording the spelling and pronunciation of tricky words so you can play them back if you need help to remember them.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "transcript": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And me, Catherine. Hello.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>And today, we’re talking about the third conditional. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes - we’ll be looking at why and when we use it.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And we’ll see how to form it…</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>There’ll be at a very helpful pronunciation tip…</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>And there’ll also be a third conditional quiz at the end of the show!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, the main use of the third conditional is to talk about imaginary situations in the past. And here’s Mike with our first example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>I was really late for work today. When I got to the station, it turned out the trains were cancelled. <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And Mike’s last sentence is describing an imaginary situation. In reality, Mike was late for work because he didn’t know the trains were cancelled, and he didn’t take a bus. He uses the third conditional to imagine a different past situation when he says: <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Let’s take a closer look. There are two parts to this sentence. One part is made with <strong>if </strong>plus <strong>past perfect</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span><strong>If I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled …</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the other part is made of <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>would have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>… <strong>I</strong> <strong>would have taken</strong> a bus.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And we put the two parts together to talk about an imaginary situation in the past, and its </span><span>imaginary result. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You can change the order of the two parts if you like: the meaning stays the same:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span><strong>I would have taken</strong> a bus <strong>if I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s have some more examples. Listen out for <strong>if</strong> plus <strong>past perfect</strong> with <strong>would </strong></span><span><strong>have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>I got two Ds and an F in my exams. <strong>If I had worked harder, I would have got better </strong></span><strong><span>grades.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Patty was a great singer when she was younger. <strong>She would have won that TV talent show if she had entered it.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we can use negatives in either or both parts of the sentence. Here are a couple of examples, with the negative forms <strong>hadn’t</strong> and <strong>wouldn’t</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>Abid met his wife at university. They’ve been married for 3 years now.<strong> If Abid hadn’t gone to university, he wouldn’t have met his wife. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span>I registered my mobile phone on a tracker website. When I lost it, I logged on to the site and they told me where it was.<strong> If I hadn’t registered my phone, it would have been lost for ever.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>So you can see that the third conditional is very useful to talk about things we’re pleased we did, as well as things we wish we’d done differently. So what about you Neil – anything you’d change – or not change – in your past?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>I lived in Canada when I was a child and if I hadn’t lived in Canada I wouldn’t have got dual citizenship. I’m a citizen of the UK and Canada. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And we’re talking about third conditionals. And now it’s time to talk about pronunciation. We use lots of short forms in third conditionals. And here’s Mike again with an example. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>If <strong>I’d</strong> had my camera, <strong>I’d</strong> have taken a photo. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>So in the <strong>if</strong> part, <strong>I</strong> and <strong>had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I’d.</strong> In the main part, <strong>I </strong>and <strong>would</strong> are </span><span>shortened to <strong>I’d</strong>, and we also drop the <strong>h</strong> from have. So <strong>I would have</strong> becomes <strong>‘I’d’ve’. </strong>Let’s hear another example:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><strong><span>If I’d woken up earlier, I wouldn’t have missed my flight.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>So <strong>I had</strong>  become <strong>I’d</strong> in the if part and <strong>would not have</strong> becomes <strong>‘wouldn’t’ve’</strong> in the </span><span>main part. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Now it’s time for a quiz! I’m going to say two sentences, and you have to use them to make a third conditional sentence. Here’s the first one. Mike forgot Jane’s birthday. She was upset.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>If Mike hadn’t forgotten Jane’s birthday, she wouldn’t have been upset. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Good. Another one: I ate too much. I feel sick.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>If I hadn’t eaten too much, I wouldn’t have felt sick.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>And the last one: I didn’t go to the party. I didn’t meet Francesca.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I would’ve met Francesca if I’d gone to the party.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Exactly. And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. And we’ve just got time for a top tip before we finish. Remember, in standard English, there’s only one <strong>would</strong> in a third conditional sentence. We don’t use <strong>would</strong> in the <strong>if</strong> part.

So you're still in the same place. As you can see, in the sentence above, we're talking about something that didn't happen. It only happens in your imagination. It's an imagined past event.

Did it happen in real life? No, because it could only happen if the <strong>if</strong> part happened.</p>\n<p>We make the third conditional with <strong>if + past perfect</strong>, and <strong>would</strong> <strong>have</strong> <strong>+ past participle</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’d known</strong> it was your birthday … (This is the imaginary situation in the past.) <strong>I’d have bought</strong> you a present.

Yes, she was. But the speaker didn't know that. The <strong>if part</strong> talks about <em>knowing</em> Marta was ill, not about whether Marta was ill or not.</p>\n<p>The two parts can come in any order.

A project can be many things from producing a language course to building a bridge. Read our guide and learn five basic <strong>principles</strong> of project management.</p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Now you're going to read a five-point guide to project management.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you read</strong></p>\n<p>Look at these two summaries. Then read the article once, quite quickly, and decide which summary is correct.</p>\n<p>1. Good project management is about creating a plan and making sure it doesn't change.</p>\n<p>2. Good project management is about making a plan and changing it if it's not working.</p>\n<h3>The principles of project management</h3>\n<p><span>1. <strong>A good development phase is important</strong>.<br>This is when people involved in the project decide the <strong>objectives</strong>: what it aims to achieve and within what time. They calculate costs and if they do this carefully, the better the chance of success. In some cases, if they hadn't noticed the need for extra <strong>funding</strong> at this early stage, the projects would have failed.</br></span></p>\n<p><span>2. <strong>Roles and goals</strong> <strong>must be clear and realistic</strong>.<br/>The project manager is responsible for the achievement of the objectives, and a <strong>kick-off </strong>meeting with the project team helps everyone to understand their <strong>roles</strong>. Further meetings take place to discuss individual workers' goals and these goals should be realistic. There are many examples of projects where they were not and problems arose as a result. </span>If the project manager had considered the team members' goals more carefully, they could have avoided many problems.</p>\n<p><span></span><span>3. <strong>The schedule and risks must be managed efficiently</strong>.<br/>The project manager produces the schedule and uses it to check that the team have completed tasks on time. <strong>Higher</strong> <strong>management</strong> will need reports at regular meetings, where they consider any risks to the project in terms of funding, time or staff. They make <strong>key</strong> decisions at these meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span>4. <strong>Have good communication within the team</strong>.<br/>There are many examples of projects on which the staff would have felt more <strong>motivated</strong> if there had been more communication. For project managers, good <strong>social skills </strong>and regular contact with the team are essential to make sure that everyone remains involved and informed.</span></p>\n<p><span>5. <strong>Be ready to adapt</strong>.</span><strong><br/></strong><span>Projects rarely go exactly as expected. Good project management requires the ability to deal with new challenges as a project develops.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Which was the correct summary?</h3>\n<p>The correct summary was:</p>\n<p>2. Good project management is about making a plan and changing it if it's not working.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge the <strong>third conditional</strong>. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>We hope you now understand more about project management.

Today we're talking about false friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But false friends aren't people! False friends are words that look or sound the same in two different languages - but have different meanings in each language.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right and today we'll give you plenty of examples...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...there will be a quiz of course...</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and we'll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But first, here's Jim. He works as a student advisor, and he's talking about students' problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While you're listening to Jim, try to guess what the student called Camilla's problem really was.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jim<br/></strong>Lots of students come to me with their problems, but sometimes I have to guess what they mean! Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was busy in the <strong>kitchen</strong>. Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face. Camilla, from Spain, didn't know what to do because she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>. And when I helped Pierre, he said \"Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, did you guess what Camilla's problem really was?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is Camilla was actually <strong>pregnant</strong>! But she used the wrong word when she said she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She did. Because <strong>embarrassed</strong> is a false friend in Spanish and English. The Spanish word <strong>embarazada</strong> means <strong>pregnant</strong>. Apologies for my Spanish pronunciation there! Spanish speaking people need to be very careful before they tell someone they are <strong>embarrassed - </strong>or that their husband is! Listen out for more false friends in this clip.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jim<br/></strong>Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was in the<strong> kitchen</strong>. Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So I'm guessing that Claus didn't really want a <strong>rat</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I don't think so, I think he wanted some <strong>advice</strong> from Jim. The German word <strong>r</strong><strong>at</strong> means <strong>advice</strong> in English. And Claus was worried because his father was in <strong>prison</strong>. The word <strong>kitchen</strong> can mean <strong>prison</strong> in German.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Confusing. And what about Simone, who said she had <strong>buttons</strong> on her face...</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Indeed. In French, the word <strong>boutons</strong> means <strong>spots</strong>. So, Simone thought that the English word buttons had the same meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now, let's have another clip. Pierre also said something quite strange.</p>\n<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Jim<br/></strong>And when I helped Pierre, he said \"Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So do you think that Jim was upset when Pierre said that? After all, Jim was trying to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, Pierre didn't mean to be rude. But in French <strong>terrible </strong>- like terrible - can have two meanings. It can mean <strong>very bad</strong>, but it can also mean <strong>great</strong>. It depends on the sound of your voice when you say it. Pierre meant that Jim's advice was <strong>great, </strong>not <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Wow, big misunderstanding. So the message is: don't get upset if someone from another country says something that seems a bit strange or perhaps rude. They might just be using a word that's a false friend.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Exactly. And be very careful yourself when you're speaking in another language. You know, there was this one time, I was in a hotel in France and I asked for a <strong>cushion</strong> - I thought that meant a cushion - for my bed. But it sounded like the French word <strong>cochon</strong> which means <strong>pig</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So you asked for a pig for your bedroom!</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT</strong>         <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Today, we're going to play a guessing game. So number one: If a French man is holding some £10 notes in his hand but he says that he's got no money, what does he mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The answer is that he means he's got no coins. Yes, <strong>monnaie</strong> in French means <strong>coins</strong> or <strong>change.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very good. And number two: If a German woman in an English restaurant says that she wants to <strong>become</strong> a steak, is she joking - or does she really want to turn into a meal?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Well, the answer is neither.<strong> Bekommen </strong>in German is a false friend for<strong> become </strong>in English<strong>. </strong>She means that she wants to get a steak to eat.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right then. Number three: If someone from the US invites you to a party, Finn, and tells you to wear <strong>pants</strong>, should you be shocked?</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, actually, no, you shouldn't. <strong>Pants</strong> in American English means <strong>trousers</strong>. It doesn't mean <strong>underwear</strong> like in British English!</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's a relief! And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Keep a note of false friends between your language and English. You could use word cards, with the word on one side and the information with example sentences on the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And there's more about this at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

I'm <strong>embarrassed</strong>.\" What did she mean - and why did no-one give her a seat? Catherine and Finn talk about 'false friends' in 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Listen to the audio</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>You can download 6 Minute Vocabulary from our <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-10/downloads\">Unit 10 Downloads</a> page. Remember, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/6min_vocab\" target=\"_self\">podcast version</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3>\n<p>False friends are words that look the same in two languages but have different meanings. Some examples of false friends with English words are:</p>\n<p><strong>embarazada</strong> - embarrassed<br/>Embarazada means <strong>pregnant</strong> in Spanish</p>\n<p><strong>rat</strong> - rat<br/>Rat means <strong>advice</strong> in German.</p>\n<p><strong>boutons</strong> - buttons<br/>Boutons means <strong>spots on your face</strong> in French.</p>\n<p><strong>terrible</strong> - terrible<br/>Terrible can mean <strong>very bad</strong> or <strong>very good</strong> in French.</p>\n<p><strong>monnaie</strong> - money<br/>Monnaie means <strong>coins</strong> or <strong>change</strong> in French.</p>\n<p><strong>bekommen</strong> - become<br/>Bekommen means <strong>to get or have something</strong> in German.</p>\n<p><strong>pants</strong> - pants<br/>Pants means <strong>trousers</strong> in American English.</p>\n<p>When you are learning a language, it's easy to make a mistake by using a false friend. So don't be surprised if people from other countries do this.</p>\n<p>Take time to learn false friends between your language and English so that you don't say strange or rude things by mistake.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Loanwords</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>The English language borrows a lot of words from other languages.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Words like <strong>sushi</strong> from Japanese, <strong>ballet</strong> from French and <strong>vodka</strong> from Russian are all widely used by English speakers today. These words are called <strong>loanwords</strong>. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>There are probably loanwords in English which come from your language. If you look them up, it's a good way to build your English vocabulary quickly, as you already know the words!</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>Cognates</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Another way to build your vocabulary is to learn <strong>cognates</strong>. These are words in different languages which have a similar form and meaning, because they all come from the same source.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>For example, the German word <strong>Brot</strong>, Dutch <strong>brood</strong> and English <strong>bread</strong> all come from the same early Germanic language. They don't have exactly the same spelling, but you can see the relationship. Another example is the word <strong>father</strong> in English, which in German is <strong>Vater</strong> and Latin is <strong>pater</strong>. It's thought that they all come from a very early language, which researchers call <strong>Proto-Indo-European</strong>.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>False friends</h3>\n<p><span><span>But be careful, there is another group of words which is more difficult. Loanwords and cognates are your friends when learning a foreign language, but there are also <strong>false friends</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Have a look at these examples:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The Spanish word <strong>embarazada</strong> looks like <strong>embarrassed</strong> in English. But they're false friends, because <strong>embarazada</strong> means pregnant! </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The French word <strong>librairie</strong> looks very similar to the English <strong>library</strong>. And they are both related to books. But while in English a library is where you go to borrow books – a <strong>librarie</strong> is where you go to buy them – it's a bookshop.</span></span></p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>First we're going to do an activity to learn some <strong>loanwords</strong>. Can you work out what the words mean - and which language they come from?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Well done. Next, we have some questions about false friends. See you there!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>It looks familiar, but…</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Now let's look at some false friends. <strong>Fattoria</strong> is a word in Italian. But what do you think it means in English? Here's a clue: it means either <strong>factory</strong> or <strong>farm</strong>... but which one?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>If you said <strong>farm,</strong> well done! Although <strong>fattoria</strong> looks like the word <strong>factory</strong>, it actually means <strong>farm</strong>. It's a <strong>false friend</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Now, to help you start exploring this aspect of language learning, let's do an activity to see if you can spot some other false friends. Read the six example sentences. Some of the words in bold are <strong>loanwords</strong> which are used correctly, some are <strong>false friends</strong> which are used incorrectly. </span></span><span><span>Can you spot which are which? Drag the words into the correct columns.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span>Example sentences</span></h3>\n<p><span>1) There was a huge student <strong>manifestation</strong> against rising fees at the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span>2) Marc would find the horror film too scary. He's very a <strong>sensible</strong> person.</span></p>\n<p><span>3) Can I borrow your <strong>handy?</strong> Mine is out of battery.</span></p>\n<p>4) Frank sleeps in green <strong>pyjamas.</strong></p>\n<p><span>5) Boris wore his most formal <strong>costume</strong> to the interview.</span></p>\n<p><span>6) Cedric lives in a <strong>bungalow</strong> in Fife.</span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>End of Session 1</h3>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed learning about false friends, cognates and loanwords. Watch out for them in this unit. In the next session, we're looking at the language of cause and effect. Join us then!</p></div>",

Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this show we're talking about linking devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, linking devices. There are lots of different kinds, but today we're interested in words and phrases that link a <strong>cause</strong> – that's something that happens - with its <strong>effect</strong> <strong>or result.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So words and phrases like <strong>therefore, for that reason</strong> and <strong>because of. </strong>We'll tell you how they work…</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>…We'll give you lots of examples…</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>…And we'll finish off with a quiz to check what you've learnt.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So here we go. Let's start with an example. So Neil, do you prefer e-books or paper books?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I have to say, I'm a bit old fashioned: I like a good paper book.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Why's that then?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>It just feels more authentic.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, well, we're going to talk today, actually, about e-books, so can you give us an example sentence about e-books. Come on then Neil...</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. There has been a fall in sales of paper books<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Except to you Neil. Now those two sentences are OK. But we could make them a lot clearer and more interesting by linking the ideas in them together with a word like <strong>consequently</strong>, like this.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. <strong>Consequently,</strong> there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Consequently</strong> is a very useful linking word. It shows that the event before the word <strong>consequently</strong> is the cause of the event after it. We could also use the words <strong>therefore, as a result, for that reason, thus</strong> or <strong>that's why.</strong> They all mean the same as <strong>consequently</strong>. And they are all used to join the ideas in two sentences or main clauses together.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Although remember that some are more formal than others. We use <strong>that's why</strong> a lot in informal everyday English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I missed the bus <strong>and that's why</strong> I'm late.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good example Catherine: it would sound wrong to say <strong>I missed the bus</strong> <strong>and therefore I'm late</strong>. Now can you give us an example of a more formal use of linking devices?</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, try this one: There was a lot of opposition to the proposal; <strong>therefore,</strong> it was dropped.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Nice one. You can use <strong>consequently</strong> and <strong>thus</strong> instead of <strong>therefore</strong> in this type of sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. Now let's look at a group of words and phrases that we use to link cause and effect in a slightly different way.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some examples are: <strong>because of, as a result of, due to</strong> and <strong>owing to</strong>. Listen.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books, there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So how is that different? Well, <strong>due to</strong> is followed by a noun phrase – <strong>the increasing </strong><strong>popularity of e-books</strong> – not a complete sentence or main clause. We could also say <strong>due </strong><strong>to e-books increasing in popularity. </strong>That's a participle clause.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>due to</strong> joins a noun phrase or a participle clause to the main clause in the sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. And <strong>as a result of, owing to</strong> or <strong>because of </strong>do too. We could use any of these in that example because they mean the same as <strong>due to</strong>. But <strong>because of</strong> is less formal than the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, and we could also put the sentence the other way round, like this Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There has been a fall in sales of paper books <strong>due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it just depends which part of the sentence you want to emphasize by putting first.</p>\n<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're looking at linking devices of cause and effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now for a couple of tips. When you start a sentence, in writing, with a noun phrase, be sure to use a comma after it.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fall in paper book sales,</strong> (comma) some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. But don't use a comma if the noun phrase comes at the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if we're using a verb phrase, we can introduce it with the phrase <strong>the fact that.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. You could say <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fact that book sales have fallen,</strong> some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And now it's quiz time! Complete these sentences. Number 1. Our climate is changing a) due to the Arctic ice is melting. b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The answer's b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done! Number 2. Lewis was promoted a) for that reason his hard work. b) as a result of his hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's b) as a result of his hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very good! Number 3. The accident happened a) owing to the fog on the motorway. b) owing to the fog was on the motorway.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>This time it's a) owing to the fog on the motorway.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done indeed! I hope wherever you are, you listened carefully to the show and <strong>as a result</strong> you got all the answers right.</p>\n<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's good and there's more about this on our website at <a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

        "content": "<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><span><span>Some useful phrases</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>In this session we're going to teach you some useful <strong>linking devices of cause and effect</strong>. To begin with, let's look at <strong>cause and effect</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>When we speak or write, we communicate ideas. Sometimes there is a direct link or connection between one idea and the next. Idea 1 happens, then something else happens as a result, which is idea 2.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>This is a <strong>cause and effect</strong> relationship. Take a look at this example:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span><span>(Cause) The population has increased.</span></span></em></li>\n<li><em><span><span>(Effect) The government is going to build more houses.</span></span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(Cause) There was a power cut.</em></li>\n<li><em>(Effect) I couldn't watch TV.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could link these ideas with a simple word like <strong>so.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased <strong>so</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n<li><em>There was a power cut <strong>so</strong> I couldn't watch TV.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But let's learn some more advanced ways, using <strong>linking devices</strong>.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3><strong><span><span>Form</span></span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Group 1: Therefore, consequently, as a result, thus</strong></p>\n<p><span><span>These are also called <strong>conjunctive</strong> <strong>adverbs</strong>, and they all behave in the same way. So h</span></span><span><span>ow do we use them to join ideas together? This is how we could do it with <strong>consequently</strong>. Notice the comma after <strong>consequently</strong>:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased. <strong>Consequently,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or we could join the two sentences together using a <strong>semi-colon</strong> <strong>+ consequently + comma</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased<strong>; consequently,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you <strong>can't</strong> just add <strong>consequently</strong> without a semi-colon or comma. This is wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has </em><em>increased <strong>consequently</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also replace <strong>consequently</strong> with any of the <strong>Group 1 </strong>words or phrases: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The population has increased. <strong>As a result,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n<li><em>The population has increased<strong>; therefore,</strong> the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span><span>Note</span></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Therefore</strong> and <strong>consequently</strong> are used mainly in writing or formal speech. <strong>Thus</strong> is a little old-fashioned but is sometimes used in academic writing. <strong>That's why</strong> is very common in informal speech. In writing, we usually use it at the beginning of a sentence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The traffic was terrible.<strong> That's why</strong> I'm late.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span>Choose the correct answers. The first two questions will test your knowledge of cause and effect, the next four will test your ability to use linking devices from Group 1.</span></span></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now we're going to look at the next group of linking devices. Join us on the next page!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Group 2 linking devices</h3>\n<p>Let's meet our next little group of linking devices: <strong>because of</strong>,<strong> as a result of</strong>,<strong> due to </strong>and<strong> owing to</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Noun phrases and participle clauses</strong></p>\n<p>With Group 2 linking devices, the <strong>cause </strong>part is not a whole sentence or clause, it's a <strong>noun phrase</strong> (a phrase that behaves like a noun) or <strong>participle clause </strong>(a short phrase that begins with a verb, usually in the<strong> -ing form</strong>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>interest rate rises</strong> (noun phrase)</li>\n<li><strong>rising interest rates</strong> (participle clause)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's imagine a <strong>cause and effect</strong> situation: interest rate rises are the <strong>cause </strong>of price increases. This is one way we could connect them using <strong>owing to</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>owing to</strong> <strong>interest rate rises</strong>. </em></li>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>owing to rising interest rates</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><strong>2) Position</strong></p>\n<p>In Group 1, the <strong>linking device </strong>usually comes <strong>between</strong> the <strong>cause</strong> and<strong> effect </strong>parts. <strong>Cause</strong> is always first, and <strong>effect</strong> is second.</p>\n<p>With Group 2, the <strong>cause</strong> can come first or second, and the <strong>linking device</strong> moves with it. Notice that you need a comma after the<strong> linking device</strong> if it's in the first part of the sentence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>As a result of interest rate rises</strong>, the problem has increased.</em></li>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>as a result of interest rate rises</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Take note: The fact that</strong></h3>\n<p>We can use a <strong>group 2 linking device +</strong> <strong>the fact that + a verb phrase:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The problem has increased <strong>owing to the fact that interest rates are rising</strong>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Take note: as a result</strong> and<strong> as a result of</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>As a result </strong>is in Group 1, and <strong>as a result of</strong> is in Group 2! They look very similar but behave differently.</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>It's time to test yourself again.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Next</h3>\n<p>Now it's time for a good summary of all these points in 6 Minute Grammar.

Anna – the new manager of Tip Top Trading – has <strong>got her work cut out</strong>… I mean she's got a lot to do. Today she's holding an away day for everyone at the company - but unfortunately to save money the away day isn't away but at home in the office – and it's not a day either – just a morning. Anna's got to deliver some more bad news about saving money…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>I dunno, things must be bad – look they've only given us cheap biscuits to have with our tea – not those delicious Danish pastries we used to have…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>… I know and look - no Earl Green tea either…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>…No it's Earl Grey tea Denise… didn't you know that?</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>[whispering] Anna are you OK? You're looking a bit nervous.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>I am. I've got some bad news to deliver – we might have to lose a member of staff to save money.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Oh that's hard – you need <strong>to handle</strong> this one carefully. Explain the situation and give them the back story.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>What's the back story?<br/><br/><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>The background to why the company is in this situation. Start by saying… 'Let me just fill you in with the background.'</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>OK. Here goes. [To team] Could you all take your seats please…</p>\n<p>[groans and grumbles as people sit down]</p>\n<p>Right. I hope you enjoyed your tea and biscuits…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[whispering] biscuit more like.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>… now for the second part of our away day we need to talk about staffing. Let me fill you in with the background… as you know we're working in tough economic conditions. Last year head office told us we had to improve sales by 10 per cent or face some serious <strong>consequences</strong> – and unfortunately we have only increased by seven per cent.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>I knew it! I'm going to be <strong>sacked</strong> – they always get rid of the woman who looks after the stationary first.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Well, you're not far off retirement anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>[tuts] Cheeky!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>So Anna – whose fault is it that we haven't met our sales targets – not me, obviously!</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Anna, you need to give them the reasons for not meeting the <strong>sales target</strong>. Say 'the reason we're in this situation in the first place is…' and tell them why.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>If you think it'll work then I'll give it a go.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Go on Anna – you'll be great.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>OK. Well Tom, you're right it's not all your fault – the reason we're in this situation in the first place is we had a problem on our production line and we didn't have enough plastic fruit to sell, Then there was the small fire in the warehouse when lots of our stock melted…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Yeah – it was a meltdown!</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Ooo it was – I remember that fireman who had to carry me out of the building.<br/>Anyway, Anna, you've told us the reasons we're in the situation but what are we going to do now?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Well, as I said, we're three per cent short of meeting our sales target. So, I want you all to get into groups and have a <strong>brainstorm</strong> about a quick way to boost our sales so we can tell Head Office that we're going to meet that 10 per cent target after all. Off you go.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Great work Anna – what a leader! Despite having to deliver bad news, Anna has managed to explain the history of a situation and make everyone understand using the following phrases…<br/><br/><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Let's look at the backstory…<br/>The reason we're in this situation in the first place is…<br/>Let me just fill you in with the background….<br/>Let's just remind ourselves how we got here in the first place…</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br/>Let's see how the team at Tip Top Trading are getting on…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Anna, Anna! I've got the answer…</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>Err… we've got the answer Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Go on then…</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>According to this paperwork we make a weekly delivery to Mr Plum for… [looks at paperwork] …10 Perfectly Plastic fruit baskets - but Tom hasn't <strong>accounted for</strong> receiving the money.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong><br/>Oh really? So let's remind ourselves how we got here in the first place, shall we? It was an accounting error by… Tom!</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong><br/>[making excuses] Seriously, no, listen. I've been too busy, what with the launch of the Awesome Apple and…<br/>[realising nobody believes him] You're not going to sack me are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Denise</strong><br/>Tom...</p> </div>",

Who can force themselves to do that boring piece of maths homework when they could be watching their favourite TV show instead? And who wants to pay a bill for something they don't even use?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>On such occasions, some people might think about lying. In this article, you'll read some real excuses that people have used. You might find it difficult to believe that only one of them isn't a real excuse.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span><span>To do</span></span></h3>\n<p>Read this article quite quickly. It talks about various real excuses that people really have used. But one of them is not real - we made it up! Which one do you think is not a real excuse? The answer is at the bottom of the article.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><p class=\"instruction\">Read the text and complete the activity</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Terrible excuses</h3>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 1</strong><br>Have you ever taken a <strong>sickie</strong>? If so, what did you say to your boss? It seems many people in the UK like to blame their pets for their absence. One person said they couldn't come to work because their rabbit was missing. Perhaps that was a <strong>white lie</strong>; this next one though sounds more like a <strong>porky</strong>.</br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>A worker said that he couldn't come to work because he had to take his dog to the vet. This might seem reasonable - apart from the fact that the man told his boss his dog was dead as a previous excuse for <strong>skiving off</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>If you've ever worked as a teacher, you'll know that children can be very creative when it comes to excuses for not doing their homework. Once again, it's popular to blame pets. According to a BBC survey, almost 10 percent of excuses involve pets eating the <strong>assignment</strong>. \"The dog ate my homework\" is a <strong>legendary</strong> excuse - no one is sure if a student has ever really used it. More <strong>sinister</strong> is the claim that one pupil made: she said that she saw a ghost flying away with her homework in the night.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>But it's not just workplaces and schools which attract <strong>fibbers</strong>. People caught claiming <strong>welfare benefits</strong> illegally have also tried to <strong>con</strong> the authorities. A husband whose wife was working while also <strong>on the dole</strong> said that he didn't know she had a job because he was always in the <strong>garden shed</strong> during working hours.  </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>In the UK, people need to buy a licence in order to watch TV. And it's pets again that people rely on for their <strong>alibi</strong>. One man who didn't pay said, \"Apparently my dog, which is a corgi, was related to the Queen's dog so I didn't think I needed a TV licence\".</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Part 4</strong><br/>There are many more ridiculous excuses people have made for not doing the things they were supposed to do. But there isn't enough room on this page to fit them all. And besides, I can't carry on because the cat's eaten my keyboard.</span></span></p>\n<h3>Which excuse was not real?</h3>\n<p>We made up this excuse:</p>\n<p>\"More sinister is the claim that one pupil made: she said that she saw a ghost flying away with her homework in the night.\"</p>\n<h3>To do</h3>\n<p>Now it's time to look at the article in detail. Read it again and then answer the questions. They will test your general understanding and your knowledge of <strong>linking devices of cause and effect</strong>. Good luck!</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"text\" dir=\"ltr\"><h3>Your terrible excuses</h3>\n<p>Have you ever made a bad excuse? We'd love to hear some!</p>\n<p>Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the comments that we received:</p>\n<h3>Vasyl, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>Once, when I went to school, I was late. Entered the premises I was caught by principal, consequently I was compelled to write an excuse of such a  misdeed. Owing to a great deal of time and calling bad weather to witness, I narrated a whole detective story in which I had been hiking and splashed up by car. As a result I came back home to change an attire. In excuse I noted the vehicle's brand, colour and even the registration number as though I could really recall it and it had the slightest importance!</p>\n<h3><strong>Manoel, Brazil</strong></h3>\n<p>The worst excuse I've ever made was ten years ago. I had forgotten completely my wife's birthday and when I came back home from the work, I heard my daughter giving congratulations to her mommy. I hadn't bought a present; as a result, I didn't know what to say. Then I told a white lie. I said to her that I really bought a gift, but when I was coming home, I saw a very sad poor woman. I felt sorry and I gave her the present that I've bought.</p>\n<h3>Trinh Viet Linh, Vietnam</h3>\n<p>I would like to tell about one of my bad excuse to refuse drinking alcoholic drinks.</p>\n<p>First of all, let me just fill you in with background. There is a fact that Vietnamese use too much alcoholic drinks, brandy in particular, whereas fake and imitation ones are widespread on the market. As consequently, it is really high risk for the drinkers. In addition, I am really not good at drinking. I therefore always refuse whenever to be offered to drink and I always excuse by saying that I have a problem with my stomach that the doctor directed to keep away from alcoholic drinks. It is a white lie, of course, but it worked. </p>\n<h3>Juan Carlos, Colombia</h3>\n<p>Hello everybody, really yes, I have made several bad excuses in my life, but the worst excuse that I have made it was when I was studying at the college school. Let me just fill you in with the background...three years ago, I had to take a test of the subject of fuzzy control, but the last night before the test, I went to a party with my friends and we started to drink different kind of alcoholic drinks and the next day I had a terrible hangover and I was to call to the university and I told them that I crashed my car the last night and I was arrested that night. Two days after, Finally I took the test but, I lost it.</p>\n<h3>Aroa, Spain</h3>\n<p>What I am going to tell you is not an excuse, it is something it really happened to me. Anyway it seems an excuse and it is very funny.</p>\n<p>It was my cousin's wedding so I got home really tired at night. I left my ID card and my driving license on the sofa and I went straight to bed. The following day I didn't find either the license or the ID card. I spent one week looking for both things. Unfortunately I didn't found them and I needed the ID card because i was going to travel so I had to renew it. After some time one day we were tidying up the drawers which were under the bed and suddenly we found both, the ID card and the driving license. Obviously they both had been bitten by my dog who seemed to have been playing with them the night of the wedding. Although the driving license was broken I didn't have the new one so I have to put that in my wallet. That night I was driving when suddenly the police stopped me and asked me for the driving license. I was really really embarrased but I had to tell him that my dog had eaten my driving license. The police got a bit angry, he thought it was an excuse but I showed it to him. When he saw that he started to laugh. Thanks goodness I didn't get a fine.</p>\n<h3>Marco</h3>\n<p>Last winter, a morning I decided to stay at home avoiding to go to my work, so I invented an excuse not very brilliant. Infact I remember it was a nice day in the winter, but I called my boss telling him that there was a terrible snow storm on my village. Unfortunately my house is far from my factory only 15 kilometers. To conclude, the day after my colleagues, while I was trying to explain my terrible excuse to my boss, they kidded me imitating a man that is removing the snow.</p>\n<h3>Pierre, Belgium</h3>\n<p>Hereafter is a white lie I used to avoid to go to work:</p>\n<p>This was a day on Augustus. My boss was on holiday. At that time, my workplace was at about 120 kilometres from my house. On this morning, I didn't want to drive and I sent a message to my colleagues:</p>\n<p>\"Hi there, I'm sorry but my car seems to have a problem. The battery seems to be low. The car doesn't start. I won't be able to come at work.\"</p>\n<p>I was stupid because my car was new and all my colleagues understood the lie. The boss was on holiday; consequently, there was no consequences. But I'm ashamed to have let my colleagues worked more because of me. This will never happen again.</p>\n<h3>Marisol, Spain</h3>\n<p>I've never used any excuses for not working, but I know some people who they are real expertes.</p>\n<p>One day, a colleague called to our workplace and she said that she couldn't go to work because of she had the ash's grandfather in her car and she couldn't leave here.</p>\n<p>Another colleague said us that he couldn't go on time every day owing to he had to go out with his dog in the morning and he couldn't go earlier due to it was colder and his pet could get a bad cold.</p>\n<h3>Taras, Ukraine</h3>\n<p>I used to do bad excuses for my skiving off. These were mainly in school and I taken sickie. For examples, I missed a particular class and when I faced with a teacher as excuse I always told that I was sick and that's why I wasn't attended in the classroom. Fortunately or not, I have never taken a sickie in my job.</p>\n<h3>Mario, Italy</h3>\n<p>When I was a child, I often used to wake up late in the morning and, consequently, I often used to be late for school. Since everybody knew, including my teacher, that my house was beside the school, I always had to make up new excuses and every time I entered the classroom, my teacher asked me, ironically, questions such as 'What happened this time? Was the lift in your building on strike? Did your brother take the battery out of your alarm clock for his walkman? Did your dog hide your clothings? Parking problems?”. Fortunately, my teacher was a very tolerant person.</p>\n<h3>Ahmed</h3>\n<p>I'd like to tell you about our colleague big excuse that, all of us thought is was a serious matter, Let me fill you in with the backstory. <br/> our colleague decided to lift our company whereas he had just got a promotion hence, he was shy and didn't find any thing to tell except a huge lie! thus, he told us that he's sick and will need a serious surgery he even more visited our office wearing medical equipment and he decided to sign-off in order to make the surgery and don't waste company time with his health issue! and after few months we knew that he lift to comparative company.</p>\n<h3>Francesco, Italy</h3>\n<p>I hate to be late; consequently, I'm always just in time so I don't have to excuse me to anyone.</p>\n<p>Only once, when I was child, I came to school late because of I met Spiderman during a fight with a monster; consequently, I gave him my help to kill the monster. </p>\n<p>Another time, when I was 30, I was late to work because of Batman gave me his car but I didn't know how  land.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of situations that may embarrass us; as result, we have to learn how find a good solution.</p>\n<p>I think and hope, that all the people around the world will be able.</p>\n<h3>Rita, Spain</h3>\n<p>I have to recognize that the worst excuse i have ever given was not addressed to another person but myself. </p>\n<p>I was operated from a disc hernia and due to the fact that it wasn´t a success, i needed to be operated twice more. </p>\n<p>This happened along 5 years´ time and in the following  5 years i had a lot of suffering  owing to the pain.Therefore, i tried many therapies as rehabilitation, accupunture, quiropractics, and ozon therapy. They seemed to work for two or three months  and after that relief period,  i returned to feel so bad as before again. </p>\n<p>The point is that i had convinced myself about my own unability to recover because of my negative mental attitude.</p>\n<p>Later, big changes happenned in my life: getting divorced and moving to another town made me realize that i  could really get bettter, with some effort and lots of constance.</p>\n<p>Finally I am living on my own, with some handicaps but i am dong things i could never have imagined when i was cheated by my own mental excuses.</p>\n<h3>Pawan Bhandari, Nepal</h3>\n<p>Chucking a sickie was my bad habit when I read in school; consequently,  I had to make do on very few notes during the exams. My habit worsened when I missed the terminal exam owing to the fabrication of a lie that I was sick.  It was this time I made up the story that I had caught jaundice; but in fact, I had very minor headache. I was very apprehensive about my Principal asking me the medication report. But thankfully,  he believed me as I had told my mother to say so. Today, I remorse my wrong doings; I feel , if I hadn't been involved in pulling sickies, I would have got the better result. </p>\n<h3>José, France</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, as a student, there are some days where I don't want to do anything. So these days I made some terrible excuses to myself in order to avoid doing my homework. For instance, a very bad reason I often give to myself for not doing my homework is the fact that it's raining outside. Shame on me...</p>\n<p>There we can notice that a terrible excuse to yourself can be the origin of new meaningless excuses to other people. To go on with the example previously given, from there, my parents can notice that I'm doing nothing, so they may probably call me for houseworks. Then I will have to invent a new excuse to escape from the household chores.</p>\n<p>Finally it's a kind of a vicious circle : a lie leads to another.</p>\n<h3>End of Session 4</h3>\n<p>How was that? You have lots of excuses now. We hope you don't try to use them. Join us in Session 5 for the final part of our drama, Jamaica Inn. Mary finally discovers who murdered her aunt and uncle. Now she needs help - but who can she turn to?</p></div>",
